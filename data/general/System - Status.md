    (Dependence: Organs Efficience)
* heat              
    (Dependence: Organs Efficience)
* electrical: 
    * default value: 600ohms
    * normal human: 400(weak body e.g sickness) ~ 1000(health athletic)
    * ex: attack: 5mA | 600ohms.          defence: 400ohms
        * 400 - 600 = -200, (200 = 33% of 600), so you receive 5mA + 33% = 6.65
        * You receive 6.65mA in your body and it's effects
    * ex: attack: 5mA | 600ohms.          defence: 700ohms
        * 700 - 600 = 100, so you block 100% of the amperage
