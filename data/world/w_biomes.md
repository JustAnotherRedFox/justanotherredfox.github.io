        Forageability: 50%.
        Grazable: Only during growing season.
        Disease frequency: 1.6
        Description:
            A wetland packed with trees and vines.
            Much of the marshy land here can't support heavy structures, moving around is slow due to choking vegetation.
            Disease is endemic in this dense, wet ecosystem.
            A more wet version of the Boreal Forest.
            Like in all swamps, diseases are more common.
            The marshy soil will probably require bridges before constructing buildings and the terrain is really slow to travel, but this biome also has more fertile soil.

        Description:

            Despite its visual beauty, this is a very dangerous biome. 
            Choking overgrowth, aggressive animals, and constant sickness are why some explorers call this the "green hell".
            Tropical Rainforests are famous for having many diseases, including Sleeping Sickness: a slow-progressing, long-lasting disease that is exclusive to the tropics. 
            Many trees make it difficult to clear land and rapid plant growth makes it difficult to keep it clear.

            There is no soil for plants to grow in.
            The only animals here are migrating to somewhere else - or badly lost.
            The only land possible to farm is stony patches around hills and mountains, but they need to be heated indoors and also have sun lamps.
            You will need to do hunting, trading and cannibalism until you get a heater and a sun lamp.
            Later, moisture pumps can create larger growable areas and hydroponics can be used instead of ground.
            Geothermal vents can be used for free heating. With so few animals here, any predators that roam in will become hungry soon and target your colonists and animals.

            Sea Ice does not have ruins and geothermal vents.
            Deep drills cannot dig up stone chunks and moisture pumps will only generate more ice, which means it is impossible to grow anything on the ground.
            You will need to do hunting, trading and cannibalism until you get a heater, a sun lamp and a hydroponics basin.
            It is worth mentioning that Sea Ice was designed to not allow colony building, only to allow traveling in the area, even though it is possible.

        Disease frequency: 0.7 per year.
        Description:
            An extremely hot, dry area, devoid of almost all life.
            Searing heat and a near total lack of arable land make it very difficult to survive here.
            The hot temperatures can cause problems for Natives and animals. Its warm enough for growing plants outdoors, but it has to be done in stony patches around hills and mountains.
            Even though potatoes grows better in stony soil, you need to plant rice first so you will not starve while waiting for potatoes.
            Strawberries are also a good idea since there is no wood for cooking.
            Later hydroponics can be used instead of ground.
            This biome has patches of soft sand which prevent building, but can be removed with moisture pumps.
            Animal migrations may occur, about once every other year.

            Big animals, tall grass and few trees makes this ideal for hunting and ranged combat.

            Choking overgrowth, aggressive animals, and constant sickness are why some explorers call this the "Emerald hell".
            Irradiated Rainforests are famous for having many diseases, poisons, acid, and radioactive propertys
            Many trees make it difficult to clear land and rapid plant growth makes it difficult to keep it clear.

            Difficult movement, aggressive animals, poison, radiation and rampant disease make living here a nightmare.
            A more wet and acid version of the irradiated Rainforest. 
            Like in all swamps diseases are more common. 
            The marshy and corrosive soil will probably destroy any bridges or buildings and the terrain is really slow and dangerous to travel, but this biome also has more fertile soil, that isn't edible.
