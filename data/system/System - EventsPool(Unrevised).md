# abandoned mecha (chained event)
* name: "Mecha Graveyard"
> "The debris of ruined war machines scattered across an ancient battlefield provide continual inspiration for our engineers."

* category: "Unusual Structure"
> "Radiometric dating indicates that the world of [world.Continent.name] has been in a nuclear winter for around 800 years. 
> It is covered in the ruins of a civilization that once graced its surface. 
> However, many of those ruins, some of which are even visible from orbit, are inconsistent with any previously discovered archaeological sites."

* name: "Abandoned Mecha"
> "It would appear as though the defunct civilizations on [place.name] had been in a state of global conflict long before the invention of nuclear weapons. 
> According to [researcher.name]'s findings, before nuclear technology could even be theorized, the civilizations on [place.name] invested considerable effort into making bigger and deadlier conventional weapons of war.
> In particular, they developed armoured bipedal, tripedal and quadrupedal machines, similar to the [highTechnologicalSpecies.name]' tanks. [researcher.name] has dubbed these weapons "mecha".
> We have translated records indicating that after several decades of waging war with these machines, nuclear fission was discovered. 
> The balance of power shifted, and atomic weapons were promptly designed. 
> With no time to build up a large stockpile on each side (and thereby form the concept of mutually assured destruction), bombs were dropped as soon as they became available, which caused these civilizations to discover firsthand the long-term effects of such weapons.
> Now the abandoned mecha litter the surface. While most of the technology found in the ruins is outdated from our perspective, the mecha provide an all new outlook of mechanics. 
> Since so many can be found half-built, fully intact, and half-destroyed, we have plenty of opportunities to research them."

* name: "Unusual Ruins"
> "Scans show that the ruins on [place.area.name] are uninteresting past first glance. However, it seems their now extinct builders had a unique architectural style. 
> Unfortunately, the buildings are far too deteriorated to be studied."

# agrarian

* dig_site: "Agrarian Idyll"
> "A small isolated site on this region is covered in neat rows of farm plots - overgrown with plants, but still recognizable. 
> This feature looks very out of place, especially considering that this is the only pre-existing artificial structures on [Region.name].
> Mechanized farming equipment is still rusting in the fields, while farm owners are nowhere to be found."

* name: "Mass Grave"
> "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports discovering the likely explanation of the previous inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName]. 
> On the outskirts of the settlement, [Leader.GetSheHe] discovered a trench where multiple bodies in bags were bumped before concrete was poured over them. 
> The trench appears to be segmented with filling of uneven quality, suggesting that the process of dumping the bodies took months if not years. 
> The bodies discovered inside is estimated to account for about 60-80% of the households, depending on how communal the species was. 
> No obvious signs of trauma are found on the bodies, neither any traces of radioactive contamination, known poisons or corrosives. 
> However, due to lack of living specimen for reference and the sorry state of the mass grave in general it is impossible to infer a cause of death."

* name: "The Hospital"
> "We have discovered a half-buried building in the outskirts of the settlement. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! believes that it was served as a hospital while the colony was still alive. 
> The building itself was mostly cleared out and a lot of documents destroyed. 
> It appears that despite opting for low-tech solutions where they could, such as plant-based writing surfaces, clay brickwork and wooden furniture, the settlers did have access to advanced technologies that they used whenever necessary, such as sophisticated medical scanners and molecular pharmaceutical printers. 
> The hospital records have faded away, though §Y[Leader.GetName]§! infers a highly contagious disease has affected the settlers at some point."

agrarian.3.name: "The Antenna"
agrarian.3.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports uncovering something odd right in the middle of the abandoned settlement on [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nAt a relatively shallow depth the archaeologists have found an extremely tall antenna. Its foundation seems to be deliberately placed right in the middle of the settlement, likely to ensure stable coverage. The antenna is not designed for any faster-than-light specifications, but nevertheless it is arguably the most advanced piece of technology recovered yet. \n\nThe exact nature of the signal transmitted is uncertain at the moment, but it is likely that the source of the signal could be found underground, right under the antenna."
agrarian.4.name: "Biomass Control"
agrarian.4.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports successfully breaching the underground complex beneath the antenna on [From.Planet.GetName]. Compared to the rest of the settlement, it is extremely advanced, placing it on the level of an average space faring civilisation. Most of the equipment is broken, but some data was still recovered. The events leading to extinction of the planet's population became clear. \n\nThe settlers originated from an civilisation that was active in distant part of the galaxy as a group of primitivist seeking to escape what they perceived as oppressive technological society stifling their spirituality. \n\nWith only limited technology they deemed necessary they made their way on [From.Planet.GetName] and established a colony. In order to bolster their ranks and ensure workforce sufficient for the colony's operation they brought specially designed programmable biomass - which was at the time inferior to robotic technology but better suited for their primitivist way of life. \n\nThe underground complex and antenna were, in fact, a control system for the biomass constructs. "
agrarian.5.name: "The Masterpiece"
agrarian.5.desc: "After an extensive research, §Y[Leader.GetName]§! have pieced together the rest of the events that caused to the colony on [From.Planet.GetName] to collapse. \n\nFor a while, colony operated smoothly and settlers enjoyed a simple life until they encountered an infection, likely native to the world. Most of them succumbed quickly, but for a small fraction it would take years to die. Despite the quarantine measures, the infection spread could not be stopped and all settlers contracted it. The only unaffected form of life was the biomass. Realizing they are doomed, settlers opted to copy their minds into the biomass control system and live their lives as constructs. \n\nOne technician involved however had a different plan. Seeing himself as some kind of ultimate artist, he sabotaged the transfer system to give himself full access to personality cores. After the process was complete, he has erased all other settler's memories of their true nature and dedicated all his time to tinkering with their personalities. Unaware of anything that is happening or who they really are, the practically immortal settlers relived the same day again and again as biomass constructs among slowly decaying buildings and neglected fields, while the only self-aware person kept altering their personalities and memories to create something more to his liking. \n\nThis process lasted for about 40 years until a power outage interrupted the transmission and caused all constructs to disintegrate. It seems the only person who knew that the complex even existed had no interest in maintaining it."
agrarian.5.a: "A fascinating tale."

d_agrarian_deposit: "Desolate Farmlands"
d_agrarian_deposit_desc: "A sizeable area once settled by a group of alien colonists. The fertile lands lie abandoned after their owners died out from an epidemic."

ancient_factory.10.name:0 "Abandoned Factory"
ancient_factory.10.desc:0 "According to a survey by Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], the strange rock formations on [From.GetName] are not rock formations at all. They are, in fact, some sort of automated mega-factory, constructed by unknown makers and, judging by its rundown state, abandoned long ago. Despite being far too damaged to be repurposed for our own needs, further study of the complex could be useful for our own factories and automation systems."

ancient_factory.20.name:0 "Unusual Structure"
ancient_factory.20.desc:0 "The unusual rock formations on [From.From.GetName] are just that - unusual rock formations. They appear to be some sort of self-contained badlands, too small for our scanners to register as a fully-fledged region."

It seems to be filled with small metallic spikes arranged in a regular grid pattern. However, they are too small to properly discern from orbit. We should examine it more closely."

ancient_graveyard.1.name:0 "A Final Resting Place for Many"
ancient_graveyard.1.desc:0 "Our survey team discovered almost a billion upward-faced primitive pulse rifles dotting the valley, each muzzle topped by what appears to be a visored helmet of alien design. This appears to be the resting place of countless soldiers fallen in a long forgotten war. Although well-preserved in almost vacuum, the primitive rifle design is of little interest to our scientists. Deep scans into the ground underneath also revealed nothing of value. It seems we'll never know what really happened here, all those aeons ago."

ancient_graveyard.2.name:0 "A False Positive"
ancient_graveyard.2.desc:0 "It appears the strange pattern was nothing but an echo caused by an improperly calibrated sensor. Our survey team found nothing down there, and a second sensor sweep did not repeat the prior results."

# ancient_robots (Chained Sequence Events)
## Start of Ancient Robots Sequence:

 ancient_robots.201.name:0 "Not the First"
 ancient_robots.201.desc:0 "While prospecting a promising area, our colonial mining corporation made a remarkable discovery on §Y[Root.GetName]§!. They found fragments of an ancient humanoid robot that seems to be millions of years old. This find disproves our assumption that we were the first intelligent lifeform to inhabit this planet. More thorough scans of the planet will be needed to shed more light on this precursor civilization."
 ancient_robots.201.a:0 "Make it so!"
 
## Initial Scanning Special Project:
 
 ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT:0 "Further Planetary Scans"
 ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our scientific community urges us to perform more thorough scans of §Y[This.GetName]§! in order to determine promising locations for archaeological excavations. They emphasize that we could uncover more about the ancient precursor civilisation that once inhabited the planet."

## Further Scans Performed:
 
 ancient_robots.203.name:0 "Not a Mountain"
 ancient_robots.203.desc:0 "Our scientists were already pleading to finally stop these fruitless scans on §Y[Root.GetName]§! when a mountain - or, at least, what we formerly believed to be a mountain - turned out to be something else. What it might be specifically is still unknown, but one thing is certain: It is made of metal, and a tremendous amount of it. §Y[From.GetLeaderName]§! has proposed an excavation to find out what lies under the rock.\n\nThe estimated cost for this endeavour is 1000£energy and 1000£minerals ."
 ancient_robots.203.a:0 "Do it!"
 ancient_robots.203.b:0 "Ask me again later."
 ancient_robots.203.c:0 "No, and don't ask me again."
 
## Reminder:

 ancient_robots.204.name:0 "Excavation Plans"
 ancient_robots.204.desc:0 "The scientific community on §Y[Root.GetName]§! wants to remind you that their planet still has a major unsolved mystery. Plans for the excavation of a bizarre metal mountain have been postponed until now. Our scientists once again request that we back this undertaking.\n\nThe estimated cost for this endeavour is 1000£energy and 1000£minerals ."
 ancient_robots.204.a:0 "Do it!"
 ancient_robots.204.b:0 "Ask me again later."
 ancient_robots.204.c:0 "No, and don't ask me again."
 
## Excavation Project:

 ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_2:0 "Excavating the Mystery"
 ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_2_DESC:0 "After raising the needed funds, our construction crews can finally begin the real work in investigating the mysterious metallic mountain. To abrade away an entire mountain is neither a small feat nor done in one day."
 
## Excavation Completed:

 ancient_robots.206.name:0 "An Ancient Factory"
 ancient_robots.206.desc:0 "Thanks to our previous scans, our teams at the excavation site were unsurprised when they found an alien mega structure beneath the thick layer of rock. What did surprise them is that, despite its age of millions of years, it is still largely intact. Our team has already managed to access what seems to be a robot assembly plant with a connected factory for manufacturing individual components. Some of these robots have been sent to research labs for closer examination. Meanwhile, the science teams will try to establish a forward base inside the structure. They hope to be able to power at least parts of the ancient machinery."
 ancient_robots.206.a:0 "Astounding! Go on."

## Someone Else Did the Excavation:

 ancient_robots.207.name:0 "An Ancient Factory"
 ancient_robots.207.desc:0 "It seems some private investors funded an excavation on §Y[Root.GetName]§! to find out what mystery lies beneath that anomalous mountain range we found a few years ago. At first, they deemed their undertaking to be very profitable, but when they realized the significance of their finding and faced with possible legal actions towards them should they not inform us, they contacted the local governor. Under tons of rock lies an impressive structure formerly used to mass produce some kind of robots. Some units have already been sent to research labs for closer examination while our science teams at the site prepare to reach further into that complex."
 ancient_robots.207.a:0 "A smart decision. Go on."
 
## Analyzing Robot Parts: 

 ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_3:0 "Ancient Robot Analysis"
 ANCIENT_ROBOTS_PROJECT_3_DESC:0 "Our scientists are eager to start studying the ancient robot units found in a precursor factory."
 
## Happy Outcome of the Discovery:

 ancient_robots.208.name:0 "A Ghost in the Shell"
 ancient_robots.208.desc:0 "When our scientists managed to connect the factory complex to our colony's energy grid, they unwittingly initiated a chain reaction, activating the whole complex instead of only some parts of it. This led to a short blackout in our colony before they were able to compensate for the unexpected energy drain. After the initial flurry, they noticed small drones flying around and starting to repair structural damage - but the most fascinating find was an AI operating the facility. Despite the fact that this place seems to be of military origin, it is quite docile and accepts us as its new masters."
 ancient_robots.208.a:0 "As it should be."
 
## Robots Attack! - Immediately on Excavation:

 ancient_robots.209.name:0 "King of my Castle"
 ancient_robots.209.desc:0 "When our scientists managed to connect the factory complex to our colony's energy grid, they unwittingly initiated a chain reaction, activating the whole complex instead of only some parts of it. This led to a blackout in our colony. After powering up again we received a short, interrupted message from our science team saying that an AI program has taken control of the facility. Since then, we have received nothing but silence. Intel from orbital satellites shows an army of robots pouring out of the facility. The colonial defense force is on high alert."
 ancient_robots.209.a:0 "Send in reinforcements!"
 
## Robots Attack! - After Working For a While

 ancient_robots.210.name:0 "King of my Castle"
 ancient_robots.210.desc:0 "The AI managing the ancient factory on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has gone rogue. Armies of robots are pouring out of the complex. Our colonial defense force has been completely caught by surprise and is barely managing to hold its position. They demand immediate reinforcements, or the colony might fall."
 ancient_robots.210.a:0 "Send in reinforcements!"

## Under Siege Modifier:

## Victory Over Initial Robot Attack:

 ancient_robots.211.name:0 "Gaining the Offense"
 ancient_robots.211.desc:0 "Our forces have managed to drive the robots back to their source. But an attack on the citadel, as the factory is called by our generals, would be futile without preparation and considerable ground forces. They have devised plans for a military campaign to retake the citadel. As soon as our ground forces are ready, we can start the siege."
 ancient_robots.211.a:0 "Start the preparations."
 
## Defeat in Initial Robot Attack:

 ancient_robots.212.name:0 "Colony Overrun"
 ancient_robots.212.desc:0 "Our colonial defence forces have been overrun by the machines. Our colonists are on the run and hiding in the outskirts of the colony, but the robots have already begun hunting them down. We must push them back!"
 ancient_robots.212.a:0 "Send our forces!"
 
## Siege Project:

 SIEGE_PROJECT:0 "Besieging the Citadel"
 SIEGE_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our forces are in place. Artillery fire is forcing the robots onto the defensive while our forces prepare to make the final push into the breach."

 ancient_robots.213.name:0 "Doomsday"
 ancient_robots.213.desc:0 "The final assault has begun. Our forces have begun an all-out attack on the citadel."
 ancient_robots.213.a:0 "To victory!"

## Victory Over Evil Robots:

 ancient_robots.214.name:0 "Victory!"
 ancient_robots.214.desc:0 "The attack was successful. Our forces reached the citadel's center and disabled the AI's processing core. Once no longer controlled by the AI, all remaining robots deactivated themselves. After the fighting was over our soldiers discovered an ancient data cache containing a variety of useful data ranging from historical documentations to scientific insights near the shutdown AI Core.\n\nWith this factory under our control once more, we may use the remaining rare resources to build a limited number of robots for our own armies. Perhaps these can give us an edge over our foes."
 ancient_robots.214.a:0 "Compliment our troops on their victory."

## Defeat in Second Robot Attack:

 ancient_robots.215.name:0 "Day of Reckoning"
 ancient_robots.215.desc:0 "Our forces walked right into a trap. The battle was over before our generals even knew a trap had been sprung. Robots poured out of the ground surrounding the attacking army, catching them totally unprepared. Shortly thereafter, we lost all contact with ground personnel. Orbital satellites reveal what has happened since our defeat. §Y[FROM.FROM.GetName]§! is uninhabitable now - a giant graveyard and monument to our failed attempt to acquire technology that is far above our understanding."
 ancient_robots.215.a:0 "How terrible!"
 
## Robot Analysis Completed:

 ancient_robots.220.name:0 "Ancient Robots"
 ancient_robots.220.desc:0 "These recovered robot units, despite being millions of years old, seem to be of a very advanced design that our scientists cannot even begin to recreate with our current level of technology. They seem to be made for a single purpose that every single part of them screams out: War. We cannot copy them, but our own research on advanced robotics will greatly benefit from this find."
 ancient_robots.220.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 #A small group of citizens have barricaded themselves.
 ancient_robots.225.name:0 "Isolated"
 ancient_robots.225.desc:0 "The siege has claimed many lives. Only a small group of citizens were able to barricade themselves in an area where they are safe for the time being."

# ancient_satellite

 #Ancient Satellite Anomaly
 #Writing and idea by ForeMole
 #Code by LamilLerran
 ancient_satellite_category:0 "Deep Solar Device"
 ancient_satellite_category_desc:0 "Scans of §Y[Root.GetName]§! show a large object of unknown origin just above the scorchingly hot chromosphere of the star. This object is slowly orbiting around the star at a stable orbit, but how it got there and how it remains intact is as of yet unknown."
 ancient_satellite.1.name:0 "Ancient Satellite"
 ancient_satellite.1.desc:0 "Further study shows that the device close to the surface of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! is some sort of entirely automated ancient research station. By all accounts, the device should not be able to remain secure, but an advanced design has protected it from the harsh environment. The satellite, however, is responding to §Y[Root.GetName]§!'s hails, returning information on the dangerous environment of the star - and obeying simple orders given to it, including orders to change its location.\n\nTwo proposals have been made. We could keep the station where it is now and use the unique location to our advantage, or we could order the station to travel to a higher orbit so that we can safely study the satellite's composition. Either choice would provide information possibly hundreds of years beyond what we could currently know, but only one can be made. How should we proceed?"
 ancient_satellite.1.a:0 "Leave it there and study the star."
 ancient_satellite.1.b:0 "Bring it up. Let's see what this thing is made of."
 ancient_satellite.100.name:0 "Coronal Mass Ejection"
 ancient_satellite.100.desc:0 "While getting closer to §Y[From.From.GetName]§!'s surface in order to further analyze the mysterious object, a sudden solar flare forced the §Y[Root.GetName]§! to retreat. After a series of well-executed maneuvers from the ship's pilots, they managed to safely make it out of the way. However, further attempts to detect the object have failed. How it had survived previous coronal ejections is unknown, but the fact remains that it appears to have been destroyed."

Radar and gravimetric telemetry have also revealed that the core of the asteroid is much denser than it should be if it were a natural formation.\n\nOur working theory is that this was a weapon targeted at a planet, moon or large station, and was disguised to look like a wayward asteroid at first. Only once it had impacted would its nature as a targeted kinetic kill vehicle be revealed. With its original core replaced by tungsten and other heavy elements, it would have enough mass to potentially render an entire world uninhabitable.

The strong would violently coerce their weaker brethren to follow their orders, while fighting one another for the dominance. The strongest of them would be called a §YCharmakar§! and serve as a leader of a clan. \n\nThe life of Charmak was short and brutal, but for those unfortunate enough to cross paths with them, it was much worse. They were a society of planet looters, attacking planetside settlements with reckless disregard for personal safety, killing and pillaging everything they came across. \n\nVery few of their activities didn't revolve around this never-ending looting - most of those not involved in combat would work on manufacturing and designing new weapons; the select few who lived to become too injured or infirm to fight or work would find employment creating art to inspire their comrades to pillage harder or cataloguing trophies gained in the recent raids."

They had conducted a series of hit-and-run attacks on smaller, more isolated clans in the horde, which for the Charmak was something unheard of - and finding themselves on the receiving end of the attacks for once was a cause of great concern. \n\nMany Charmakars pledged their clan's support to the retaliation campaign."

Large numbers of Charmak who were captured in the initial raids were found, liberated and publicly shamed for their weakness, however something strange happened afterwards. \n\nIt appears their captors were trying to turn their prisoners to their side and in doing so discussed in great detail their social and political differences. The captives then passed what they learned on to the rest of the Charmak. \n\nNever before had the Charmak bothered to study the structure of the societies they terrorized, and while revelation that it's possible to select one's leaders based on something other than their capacity for violence did not impress them at first, it had a profound effect on their psyche in the long run. The more their thought about this, the more it caused them to doubt the Charmak ways, eventually driving them to compulsive insubordination or deep melancholy, where they would simply refuse to follow orders, even when threatened with death, and ultimately refused to eat, drink and maintain their ships. \n\nWithin a decade, their entire society had collapsed and their once fearsome species became extinct.

State-of-the-art shielding technology on the wall prevents any scans that try to reach through the ground - for them, the wall looks like the same rock all the way through. \n\nSmall-scale demolitions were conducted in the cliff's face to reveal more of the wall's structure. It is not all smooth, and a spiral ramp of a sort crosses it, giving the whole thing the semblance of a giant §Sscrew§!, or perhaps a drill of a sort. \n\n§Y[Leader.GetName]§! now intends to start exploring other possible angles, starting from the top."

The data cores are fused into lumps of molten carbon by some kind of self-destruct mechanism, but some of the more intriguing details have been revealed by studying the machinery. \n\nFor one, this structure was not originally built on this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. It was assembled elsewhere, then dropped from the orbit and left to burrow into the ground using the force of its own gravity backed up by supplementary power generators. Once this was done, the population would move in and the hole would be filled, burying it forever, undetectable and isolated from the rest of the world. Using its own power source, the self-sustaining complex would survive for centuries, perhaps millennia. \n\nBut most of the systems were never activated."

From them, it is now possible to discern the real purpose of the complex. \n\nThe building is called §SSanctuary 1187§! and is one of the many such structures manufactured and spread across the galaxy. \n\nThe creators anticipated that some kind of unspecified calamity would befall the entire galaxy and their worlds in particular and believed the only way their species could survive was by creating a large number of underground vaults such as this one to act as sanctuaries, hidden on remote planets. They were never meant to be found, or indeed opened from the inside, keeping the residents safe forever. \n\nThe one that was dropped on [From.Planet.GetName] was discarded however, as it landed too close to a fault line, threatening exposure. Indeed, their fears were justified, as aeons later we found it sticking out of a cliff. The technology that went into this undertaking will no doubt be useful for our own industry, but there's no information on the location of any other Sanctuaries in the galaxy or how many were deployed."

Even though it's uninhabitable now, the decaying ruins of an industrial civilization are scattered across the surface of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], suggesting relatively recent and extremely drastic climate change."
 
 cold.1.name: "The Dead World"
 cold.1.desc: "Archaeological studies on the surface of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! decisively confirm the initial observations from the orbit - the planet was, indeed, at some point home to sapient organic life, a large mammalian species who called themselves the §SHoreef§!. Their technology level was clear pre-spaceflight, although at the time of their destruction the natives were undergoing industrialization and technological progress. The process was hampered somewhat by their limited supply of energy - the planet didn't have sufficient amount of fossil fuel or fissile materials. \n\nDespite having access to weapons of mass destruction, the Horeef didn't destroy themselves in an apocalyptic war, nor is there any indication of civil unrest or invasion from space. However, there's definitely something wrong with the planet, as evidenced by the unusual pattern of decay in buildings, other Horeef remains and soil, along with ionizing radiation coming from an uncertain source. \n\nIt remains a mystery what destroyed their civilization - it is as if all life on the planet was snuffed out overnight. If it was a weapon, it's nothing we previously encountered."
 cold.2.name: "State of Decay"
 cold.2.desc: "The more §Y[Leader.GetName]§! and [Leader.GetHerHis] expedition explore the ruins of Horeef civilization, the more strange occurrences they come across. \n\nThe radiation detected earlier doesn't come from any kind of contamination by radioactive materials. Instead, stable isotopes, with a half-life of millions of years, are decaying at vastly increased speeds - enough to be detected by standard radiological equipment. Complex compounds are measurably decomposing in ways inconsistent with any chemical process we could expect to happen at freezing temperatures. Even the starry sky seems dimmer somehow when observed from the surface of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. \n\nThese phenomena are spreading radially from a spot on one of the larger landmasses. This would likely be their source."
 cold.3.name: "The Sky Razor Project"
 cold.3.desc: "The exploration of the origin point of the strange anomalies that plague §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has proven to be perilous and fruitless - the area itself has mostly turned into radioactive shifting sand. However, data from there was transferred to remote locations for backup, and some of those are still usable. \n\nAs established earlier, the Horeef struggled with energy shortages to sustain their civilization, and to combat this they started a project codenamed §SSky Razor§!. They were hoping to discover an unlimited source of energy by opening some sort of dimensional rift and syphoning it from another universe. \n\nThe facility where research was conducted worked and sent reports up until the disaster that destroyed the Horeef civilization, but from the look of it, they were not successful. In fact, according to §Y[Leader.GetName]§!, they weren't even close to any kind of working prototype - their research was complete nonsense. \n\nThis means it's highly unlikely Sky Razor is responsible for planet's destruction. Yet, there's obviously a link."
 cold.4.name: "A Hole in the World"
 cold.4.desc: "Further measurements taken at the site of the former Sky Razor facility and extensive research of the reports lead §Y[Leader.GetName]§! to the startling conclusion that the Horeef were not responsible for their destruction: someone else was. \n\nThe Sky Razor researchers were not even close to opening any kind of rift, that much is clear, but it seems someone, in a different universe - likely an alternate universe version of the Horeef - did. Their equivalent of Sky Razor was successful and tapped into our universe for an unlimited supply of energy by creating a rift on the very same spot where the Sky Razor facility stood. The initial opening caused a large amount of energy to be syphoned from the local space. This energy included the heat and energy of chemical and nuclear bonds, causing matter to be ripped apart. This effect was most devastating at the site of Sky Razor, but remained fatal to all forms life elsewhere, especially when coupled with a massive drop in temperature. \n\nThe flow of energy has slowed down since but remains a constant drain, with the rift continuing to syphon energy from the planet. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do to collapse the rift from our side or contact the other - even assuming anyone is still artificially keeping the rift open and it's not a self-sustaining runaway process. \n\nOn the other hand, as long as we steer clear of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, we would not experience any negative effect, as the drain strength decreases exponentially. If this process continues, the life cycle of the §Y[From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName]§! system's star will be shortened by merely a few thousand years and the heat death of the universe will come about a decade sooner. Hardly something to worry about."

Its tail ends with a barb, while its head ends with a large mouth adorned by two massive mandibles, alongside with long sensitive hairs and 18 beady eyes of different sizes, half of which are currently looking at [Leader.GetName], silently judging [Leader.GetHerHim]. \n\nSomebody has deliberately placed this container here with enough power and supplies to keep the creature alive for many years.

Additionally, spherical pockets of radiation just float about in space, defying all laws of nuclear physics. \n\nThe remains of the facility personnel are found more and more sparsely. On the other hand, the walls are no longer a familiar blend of alloys and polymers, but now closely resemble fossilized flesh. \n\nSome further information can be gleaned from the surviving computer terminals. The facility was built above a naturally occurring dimensional rift in §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!'s crust.

The final battle apparently cost the lives of the remaining soldiers, though they managed to secure the facility. \n\nThe logs found on their power armour give some further clarity to the situation. A being they called §YTalnekhreck§! sent one of its offspring into the facility, where it subtly influenced the personnel, demanding sacrifices to nourish itself and its parents. Over time, §YTalnekhreck§! itself has breached through, killing some of the facility personnel and mutating others. At great cost, the portal was collapsed. \n\nThe squad in charge made an attempt to destroy everything that contained otherworldly influence.

Multiple remains of several different species have been recovered alongside with their personal logs and belongings. \n\nIt seems several groups of explorers have travelled to this location in the past looking for the ill-gained treasure that Dread Pirate Raewynn amassed, including a legendary §Sceremonial mask§! he wore. This mask was a cultural icon among many marauder clans in the galaxy and whoever recovered it would command a lot of respect. \n\nTensions rose on the site as fantasies of wealth and fame clouded the archaeologists' minds until infighting broke out over control of the digging areas. Many were killed."
 dread_pirate.13.name: "Cave In"
 dread_pirate.13.desc: "[Leader.GetName] just came across a massive caved-in area in a remote section of the underground complex on [From.Planet.GetName]. It appears the section was shaken by a massive explosion with over a dozen of mangled dead bodies identifiable in a rubble. In a less affected section we have found a body with an intact datapad on it. The last entry reads as follows: \n\n§S\"Engineer Warres' log. Date: who cares. Nyrran fired me today. I told her that if we keep using high-power cutters in this area, we are going to hit a methane pocket nearby. She said I can leave if I don't believe in the mission. Just got back to the site to pack my stuff. Tried to talk some sense into Correl's team, but they all sided with Nyrran. They can blow themselves up without <<Speech recognition failure, noise too loud>> <<Unexpected end of recording>>\"§!"
 dread_pirate.14.name: "The Dormitories"
 dread_pirate.14.desc: "The archaeologists on [From.Planet.GetName] have found a series of rooms which they believe to be dormitories for Raewynn's crew. The crew is still here, dead and mummified in their beds. \n\nDue to the state of the bodies, it's impossible to be certain what killed them, but what is most weird about them is that the species they all belonged to is not known to us. Perhaps they were part of a now extinct marauder culture?"
 dread_pirate.15.name: "The Excavation"
 dread_pirate.15.desc: "Our archaeological expedition has found a massive network of tunnels below the main structure of the underground base on [From.Planet.GetName]. It seems Raewynn's forces spent considerable time looking for something in the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s crust, and some of the excavation equipment is still in evidence. Equipment of a different design, presumably placed by an archaeological expedition seeking for the Dread Pirate, is sparsely strewn across the tunnels. In an abandoned makeshift camp [Leader.GetName] has found another datapad. It contains only one message: \n\n§S\"Nyrran, I will not endanger myself and the crew by waiting for you here any longer. If you come back at any point, return to the base camp. I will leave behind enough supplies and one of the shuttles for you to get off this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], but you will not find me or anyone else. The course is pre-programmed to take you to the nearest civilized system where you will hopefully be arrested for your actions. Do not attempt to change it. It was a mistake to trust you. Good luck. Perhaps it's best if we never meet again.\"§!"
 dread_pirate.16.name: "Nyrran's Fate"
 dread_pirate.16.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has followed the tunnels to a massive empty chamber separate from the rest of the complex. Its design and technology seem very different to what Raewynn's forces were using at the time. A hatch can be found at the end of a long shaft that probably once led outside, but it seems to have collapsed as a result of tectonic activity at some point in the past. However, no sign of Raewynn or his treasures can be seen. The only interesting part of the room is the body on the floor wearing a suit with insignia identifying it as §YProfessor Nyrran§!, head of the expedition to find the dread pirate. She is still clutching a datapad. The last entry reads: \n\n§S\"Coming here was a mistake. Even if Raewynn was ever here, he's gone. The sacrifices I have made were for nothing. There's not enough oxygen left to make it to the surface, even if I wanted to, but the only thing waiting for me outside is arrest and trial for the sacrifices I had to make to get here. The deaths of all those idiots who killed each other or themselves to get ahead of me will be pinned on me. The rest of my crew is either dead or abandoned me. I will stay here and wait for death\"§!"

As you can see, the rumours of my death are somewhat inaccurate, however I did have to leave some of my belongings down there. \n\nI would like to have my mask back, please. "
 dread_pirate.24.a: "We didn't find your mask down there."
 dread_pirate.24.a.response: "Is it so? I don't believe you. \n\nYou have ransacked my base quite thoroughly. Perhaps a little demonstration of firepower would teach you not to lie to people like this."

 dread_pirate.27.desc: "We already suspected that the so-called \"Dread Pirate\" we encountered in [combat_system.GetName] was an imposter, and after studying what remains of his flagship we can confirm this. \n\nThe owner of that ship was merely a marauder warlord following a subspace signal originating from Raewynn's base on [the_planet.GetName] on a remote device that presumably once belonged to the real Dread Pirate. This is probably how he knew we visited the complex. \n\nWith this information, we were able to isolate a similar previously hidden subspace signal being transmitted from the complex.

 dread_pirate.32.c: "What happened on [the_planet.GetName]?"
 dread_pirate.32.c.response: "A great treachery. Cowards didn't have the nerve to confront me directly, so they resorted to sabotage. Most of my crew died when life support went down. I was able to escape in the tunnels below. \n\nDo you want to know what I was looking for there? Look in front of you. This ship was hidden beneath my surface. They feared I would be unstoppable if I found it. They weren't wrong."
 dread_pirate.32.d: "What is your ship exactly?"
 dread_pirate.32.d.response: "I found it deep beneath the surface of [the_planet.GetName]. That was the reason why I chose that planet as my base. \n\nI don't know who made it, but it's... old. And it is alive. When I found it, it was abandoned, alone, waiting for purpose that nobody was around to give to it. I gave it that purpose. In return it made me part of it. Kept me alive.

These aliens seem to have possessed technology comparable to our own, utilizing power armors and energy-based weaponry. Curiously, however, large portions of the storage area were occupied by a number of obsolete melee weapons, such as hammers and axes.\n\nAs investigations proceeded further within the complex, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] wandered into what [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] believed to be some kind of training hall.

From reliefs on walls, floors and everyday objects, a substantial portion of the former inhabitants' history was reconstructed by the expedition team. This facility was established in these harsh conditions under the belief that deep underneath the facility existed veins of a rare - and to them, incredibly valuable - mineral ore. By pumping magma to the surface, they were able to access a nearly inexhaustible energy source, build a defence system relying on multiple lava-floodable areas, and discovered a means of disposing their "undesirables" - as shown extensively and repeatedly in the reliefs.\n\nA finding of particular value however was a library that provided our linguists with enough samples to translate the aliens' language. Not only will this make interactions with their technology easier, it has also given us a glimpse into their humor. The archived images of the stone plates found at the various trap locations read as follows: "Watch your steps..." and "Don't touch this!" for the lava and lever trap respectively. Another example was a tombstone in one of their burial grounds showing a warrior being impaled by multiple spikes at once in its relief, with the caption "Why didn't you dodge?!" Unsurprising to say that this brought back some not-so-distant memories...\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] expects to find more information on what happened here by searching the central section, which is currently locked behind a massive gate the expedition team has yet to open."

Someone had put in a lot of effort to seal it from the inside, even to the extreme of being unable to ever open it again. Not that anyone would have tried. It appears that the inhabitants were more concerned with killing each other, though the reason for this only became clear after one of the scientists stumbled over a chronicle in the bunker's data storage.\n\nAt first, the outpost had grown steadily, and its prosperity attracted many newcomers. Many inhabitants not only worked in the mines but also engaged in the fine arts, creating objects intricately decorated with fractal images of themselves and other beautiful yet strange-looking creations. When their mining effort yielded its first successes, the colony experienced an economic boom.\n\nDespite being constantly besieged by nebulous rivals, it endured for multiple generations. However, as the dig to the planetary core drew near its conclusion, entries in the chronicle had long since turned sour, reporting of growing greed and widespread paranoia amongst the population. \n\nWith irrational behaviour and violent outbursts on the rise, everything found its culmination in a catastrophic chain of events when the 'Lord of the Guard' challenged the bunker's overseer to a duel over the possession of a highly valuable artifact mentioned only by its name: §Y'Cubortob Unil Omoth'§!. The duel quickly turned into a struggle of life and death, ending only with the challenger's victory. Subsequent entries report about consecutive duels similar to the first occurring on a daily basis. The end of the chronicle is a single line repeated over and over again: "It will be mine!"\n\nThe situation seems to have escalated quickly from that point on, prompting the excavation team to wonder what kind of object could cause an entire society to collapse. Unfortunately, no further information about the artifact has been found.\n\nIn an effort to find out more about the valuable material that was mined at this colony, the scientists proceeded to head for the core-boring section, only to be met by another barricaded doorway..."

Next to the corpse was a datapad, its contents shedding some light on the nature of the strange item. Though the only thing written in the last log entry was "Mine, it is finally mine!!!", Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] quickly concluded that the metal sabaton had to be §Y'Cubortob Unil Omoth'§!, the reason for the breakdown of this colony.\n\nOn closer inspection, it was revealed that parts of the artifact were made of the ultra-rare material the outpost had originally been established to mine. In the facility's chronicles, it was named 'living metal' for its ability to 'remember' its original form if damaged or manipulated - essentially a self-repairing material. Once the underground veins had been opened up and living metal introduced to the population, it quickly found widespread use amongst the rest of the colony. What the former inhabitants had apparently failed to realize were the adverse long-term effects on their mental health caused by prolonged contact with the material. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] wisely advised everyone to avoid direct physical contact with the substance and use protective clothing when interacting with it.\n\nThe deposit of this rare metal seems to be far from fully exploited, and if sufficient safety measures are taken, we should be able to resume mining operations here."

What's more, every species encountered so far is quite aesthetically pleasing to the crew, creating feelings of protectiveness and companionship. While [root.leader.GetName] was originally worried that this may be some pheromone or other alien phenomenon, results show that the animals in question are simply deemed "cute". The pleasing nature of the animals from [from.GetName] is too universal to be a result of natural evolution, and the current leading theory is that this world may have been the target of genetic engineering in the past to create some kind of zoo. Regardless, the friendly nature of the local fauna will be welcome if we choose to colonize the planet."

Several crew members of the [root.GetName] were lost getting samples of the wildlife, and every creature is lethal to organic life in some way or another. Genetic sampling of the species we did capture show clear evidence of genetic tampering. [from.GetName] was most likely a laboratory of the development of alien bio-weapons which eventually got loose. Whether or not the creatures destroyed their creators is unknown. Regardless, the hostile nature of the creatures will create significant barriers for our colonists if we choose to pursue colonization."

 foss_sky_dig_site: "Fossilized Skyscraper"
 fosssky_dig_site_desc: "Amidst the vast plains of craters and destruction we have observed on [From.Planet.GetName], a subterranean scan has revealed something remarkable. It appears that what was once a low valley with a cluster of high-rise buildings was either blasted over with earth or has accumulated it in the time since this world's apocalypse. \n\nThe scan shows a great deal of coagulated slag, rock, and mortar surrounding what seems to be an incredibly tall building, which by good fortune remains mostly intact. Further scans indicate most of the interior might be somewhat preserved as well but getting in and learning its secrets will require time and delicate care. \n\nHowever, in the absence of any other substantial remains, relics, or even corpses beyond splintered and fragmented bones anywhere else on the blasted landscape, this might be our only chance to learn more about these people's culture."
 
 foss_sky.1.name: "Anyone Thirsty?"
 foss_sky.1.desc: "Slowly but sure we've cleared away our initial excavation site and base camp, with the roof of the building occupying the center. Every step and grab has to be very carefully measured to avoid collapse and injury as we go further. \n\nAs it stands, we can see a landing pad for a small transport and a shack which seems to have served as a waiting area or pilot lounge. And importantly, we've discovered our first artifacts. \n\nA snack and drinks vending machine may not seem like much, but one so perfectly preserved and gently extracted such as we have found has sparked the public's imagination over what could be further down and has given us an idea of the general diet of the people that occupied it. \n\nWhat was initially considered a dead and boring wreck of a world now warrants much more attention."
 foss_sky.1.a: "$DIG$"
 foss_sky.2.name: "What a View!"
 foss_sky.2.desc: "We've worked our way downwards through the rooftop stair access - which we found to be remarkably clear of major debris - to what seems most likely to be a sky lodge. \n\nRotten but discernible furniture is scattered around, as well as the mummified remains of various individuals, many clustered around the building's elevator bank, apparently finding themselves unable to descend. We've even found unopened bottles of various libations almost immaculately preserved. It would appear the windows of this building were able to handle the combined force of an incredible amount of soil directed towards its windows from the surrounding explosive blasts, because the glass (if it can be called that) has not a single crack. \n\nIn one area, the melted hulk of what we think is a vehicle is pressed up against the large window but has caused only exterior scratching. Some crews have been sent away from the site to try and obtain samples of this material to determine its composition, but so far it seems to be unique to the tower. \n\nThe next step will be to see if the elevator shaft is usable as a platform for making our way further downward, as the internal concrete staircase seems too heavily decayed at this time for further safe traversal."
 foss_sky.2.a: "$DIG$"
 foss_sky.3.name: "Trapped"
 foss_sky.3.desc: "The elevator shafts have proven just as durable as the exterior load-bearing structure. The doors the sky lounge inhabitants couldn't get open only gave way after several hours of attention from our best cutting lasers, and the other floors are similarly tight-bolted. \n\nHaving made our way through, we have been able to catalog several distinct artifacts and species' remains from the next 30 floors down or so over the last few weeks. In the case of the remains, most are usually clustered around the elevators, but some have been found at their desks or in break rooms with evidence of suicide or violence as their cause of death; and we've also noticed several apparent incidents of cannibalism. \n\nUpon arriving at what was probably once the ground floor of the skyscraper, we ran into two intriguing circumstances. Firstly, the elevators are still here and locked to the floor below it, preventing us from exploring any further. Also, there seems to be some kind of shield extended over what's left of the staircases, including the emergency exit staircase. Secondly, well below the elevators and towards the basement levels... we have started to pick up power signatures. \n\nThe next step will be getting below these elevators."
 foss_sky.3.a: "$DIG$"
 foss_sky.4.name: "An Ill-planned Party"
 foss_sky.4.desc: "It was decided that the best way to get past the elevators was to use brute force. Special neutron demolitions were placed on the brakes and the cables, and then the building was completely cleared of all personnel. We hit the detonator, and aside from some minor creaking, our learned assumptions about the building's incredible structural soundness and strength proved well-founded. \n\nThe cars smashed into the bottoms of their shafts, leaving us a clear path down to the basements. Upon arriving, we spent a full week cutting holes through both the outer blast doors and the only-slightly-less strong interior doors. \n\nWhat we've found is nothing short of amazing: an almost perfectly preserved bunker with nuclear generators in standby mode. Careful activation of these allowed us to check the rather primitive computers to confirm our initial suspicions about this place: the entire building was originally constructed as a fortress for this society's wealthy and powerful elites. Furthermore, it was constructed with the goal in mind that the workers on floors above would not know that this was what it was for – indeed, the blast door was hidden behind a large mural adjacent to the basement's lounge/lobby. \n\nThe whole building was to be used as a command and control center once the dust had settled, but this obviously did not come to pass. The corpses we have found down here are dated somewhat later than the ones on upper floors, indicating that they were able to survive for a time until they ran out of food supplies, at which point they suffered a similar fate to their supposed inferiors above. We can only guess that the apocalypse this planet suffered was so utterly complete and unexpected that the outside environment's toxicity and the complete burial of this central business district were not factored into their long-term plans. \n\nAs it stands, these people built themselves a slow-brew and very luxurious tomb."

At first, [Root.GetSheHe] thought them to have been large and vulnerable targets, until our science team found two high-powered shield generators deep inside a giant's steel hull. If the assumptions of [Root.GetLeaderName] are correct, they might have not just protected the Land Ship, as it is called by our team, but also entire regiments moving besides them.\n\nThere are some interesting designs that our military cannot wait to get their hands on."

They were able to pinpoint the part of the brain used to establish the link, although their hypotheses into its functioning are largely speculative.\n\nThey do not believe that [hive_encounter_hive_country.GetSpeciesAdj] drones are inherently incapable of independent thought - nothing in their neural structure would seem to preclude it, despite strong inhibitions which are in place to prevent it - it appears that the specimens provided are simply not developed enough to support it. If anything, they resemble pre-sapient life forms, but without a survival instinct to speak of.\n\nIn time, our scientists believe that we might come to be able to have the ability to create or remove the psionic link that binds the [hive_encounter_hive_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural], effectively allowing us to create independent individual [hive_encounter_hive_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. However, that day lies in the distant future. In the meantime, our understanding of the fundamentals of biology and alien genetics has been advanced. Additionally, [hive_encounter_leader.GetName] has discovered a new interest in psionics."

 #Light Failure
 hollow_asteroid.1.name:0 "A Hollow Asteroid"
 hollow_asteroid.1.desc:0 "The asteroid was indeed found to be hollow. In fact, it is not a single asteroid per se, but a group of several smaller asteroids that somehow became entangled and were welded together by aeons of diffusion. A curious structure, though of little value."
 hollow_asteroid.1.a:0 "Disappointing..."
 
 #Critical Failure
 hollow_asteroid.2.name:0 "It was a Trap!"
 hollow_asteroid.2.desc:0 "It appears that the hollow part of the asteroid was housing some kind of alien installation. However, as our science team managed to breach the wall, they apparently triggered some sort of self-destruct mechanism, vaporizing the asteroid alongside with them and their ship."

 hollow_asteroid.10.desc:0 "As our science team found its way inside, they discovered something unexpected: dead aliens. Over a hundred bodies line the walls of the asteroids, dressed in ornamental clothes and accompanied by a variety of apparently everyday objects, preserved by the vacuum of space. Our analysis suggests that they all died over 300,000 years ago. This structure is a unique source of knowledge about this otherwise unknown alien species, their ways of life, and their physiology."

 hollow_asteroid.40.desc:0 "When the science team breached the interior of the asteroid, they found countless small living pods fixed to the outer wall. A large sphere is anchored in the centre of the space, allowing a clear view of every pod. It appears the asteroid was used by a previously unknown ancient species as a high security prison under the idea that a handful of guards could covertly observe the inmates; remains of both are still littering structures. From data traces pulled from the station's computers, it appears that a faulty software update locked inhabitants out of the system, leaving them to starve. It's not clear why they weren't rescued--or at least had their bodies recovered."

This entire place was intended to become the body of a powerful being, referred to as a Kraken, the product of genetic engineering by an ancient spacefaring race. The core and the tunnels were to be filled with organic tissue grown from gene seed preserved inside canisters. Self-propelled, self-sustaining and under its creator's mental control, it would be able to take on entire fleets by itself and win.\n\nIt appears, however, that this project was unfinished. The age of the canisters caused genetic damage to the Kraken gene seed, making it unusable.

The [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] was once infested by a single fungoid superorganism that penetrated the majority of its vegetation, stretching across all verdant landmasses, connecting them via tendrils that reached under the seas. The natural neural network possessed a consciousness of a sort and symbiotically exchanged data with other life forms through process that aren't quite understood yet.

In turn, the Old Growth turned its attention to the new arrival, trying to offload its accumulated knowledge onto them, but for some reason the Qzell were not as receptive as the native lifeforms. The interference of the mangled thoughts of a millennia-old mushroom gradually drove them mad, resulting in the collapse of the colony. \n\nThe unique biological neural network the §SOld Growth§! does not have capacity to forget anything without first transferring it elsewhere, and without a suitable host to unload the excess thoughts and knowledge onto, it became overwhelmed and grew sick. Its tendrils withered and died, and what remains alive is a relatively small (yet still massive compared to most planetbound organisms) biomass deposit near the equator.

 last_orila_1_chain_desc:0 "Aeons ago, the Orila fleet was lured into a trap. Their enemies collapsed the star the fleet was orbiting, ripping apart the Orila ships with an enormous explosion.\n\nChap'Lin himself, the then commanding officer of the Orila flagship, was among the few survivors. Every other ship in the fleet was completely obliterated, but the 'Pride of Harilla', though heavily damaged, survived the blast. The survivors were nevertheless forced to abandon ship, which has remained unrecovered to this day.\n\nThe loss of the fleet devastated the Orila nation. They were baffled as to how their technologically inferior foes had been able to collapse an entire star. As their civilization unravelled, the Orila could only assume that it must have been the work of an outside agent, yet their last bastion fell before any proof was found.\n\nWith the Orila effectively extinct, the true cause of the stellar collapse remains a mystery. But the wreckage might still be there. If we were to recover and restore it, it would surely aid our cause."

Given their aggressive behaviour, these pirates must have recognized the value of this wreckage and already begun scavenging it for advanced technology. Our only hope to find the missing energy core lies in tracing the pirates back to their home base."

The data cores appear to be mostly wiped or eroded, but we established that the complex belonged to a civilization unfamiliar to us that went by name Carcharorion. Apparently, they operated thousands of years ago in this sector of the galaxy. \n\nSomething else, however, is much more unusual. The lower level is densely packed with a large number of stasis pods containing... bodies from our own species. Many of them still wear advanced shackles or have crude implants implanted in their nervous systems. It seems these Carcharorion abducted some of our primitive ancestors and subjected them to experiments, before, for reasons unknown, choosing to kill them by cutting the power supply to stasis pods and causing them to suffocate. \n\nWe detect elevated radiation levels from the walls and equipment inside the complex. The power core seems to have either been sabotaged or suffered a leak in the past, but we cannot be sure. Residue data extracted from the data cores also contains several sets of coordinates."
 lotc.1a:0 "What happened here?"
 
 lotc.2.name:0 "Underwater Facility"
 lotc.2.desc:0 "Submerged beneath the water, our science team uncovered the ruins of a self-contained ecosystem. It appears to have been produced entirely from spaceship components. [Leader.GetName] estimates that several hundred individuals lived here until it was struck by orbital bombardment. Most of the equipment was damaged by salt water, but our science team managed to recover fragmented navigational data, which should prove useful. Strangely, both munitions stored in the complex itself and intact projectiles recovered on site used similar designs."

As our science team made their way in, they found nothing but decay and abandonment. Most of the life support and other vital systems were dismantled, but the team found an isolated holosuite they managed to power briefly with their ship's systems. When they did so, they found themselves on the surface of a strange world, staring at an unfamiliar sky. They managed to record the stars in the sky before the suite burnt out permanently. If accurate, these stars could allow us to narrow down the location of the recreated planet."

Fighting all the way through, our boarding party made their way to the ship's bridge. Some data from the flight computers was still usable. It indicated that the ship's faster-than-light technology had experienced major problems, similar to those we eliminated before we even left our home system. \n\nTampering with ship's systems appears to have triggered some kind of self-destruction sequence, causing ship to vaporise moments after our boarding crew returned."

Several of them were damaged by shots from orbit, but judging by the low intensity of these, they were stray shots. \n\nOur science team found the habitat areas devoid of any personal possessions, and no bodies were recovered, suggesting that the population abandoned this place of their own accord."

It is not entirely clear what happened here due to the extensive damage sustained by the crafts, but [Leader.GetName]'s projections suggest that several major shipyards were established in the planet's orbit, which used minerals mined from the surface for ship production. The shipyards were likely valuable military targets, explaining the massive battle over them."

 lotc.15.name:0 "Aelwyd"
 lotc.15.desc:0 "Two major features are apparent when observing the frozen planet: Massive ruined arcologies dotting its surface and even more massive impact craters. The concentration of the craters over the planet's largest landmass suggests that they were the result of deliberate bombardment. The planet seems to have undergone a small ice age as a result. \n\nThe damage to arcologies, meanwhile, extends way beyond ravages of time. Many of them have massive breaches with profiles similar to mass-driver rounds. The insides of each structure are filled with dead bodies of a species we've identified as the Carcharorion. \n\nOne of the arcologies, however, seems to have been spared direct hits. Multiple corpses have been found there, victims of famine and cold, but they appear to have been deliberately moved and stored at the lower level. It is likely someone moved the bodies there before vacating the arcology."

Carcharorion corpses are found throughout the structures, either killed by exposure to the vacuum when the walls were breached or suffering a slower death through supply shortages. Some even appear to have died from self-inflicted gunshots. \n\nThe science team also found mass graves outside, with bodies simply dumped into trenches and bulldozed over."

Large numbers of dead bodies are found inside. \n\nOur science team has managed to recover several digital manifests published across the station that indicate that it was greatly affected by supply line disruption at the onset of war.

Another noteworthy element on the surface are the bodies of security forces, many of whom have apparently died of self-inflicted wounds. The lower levels reveal something different - bodies of prisoners outfitted with neural implants of a sort.

However, some data cores were recovered. They have two distinct sets of entries in them. The first contains references to proof of alien activity in the system and some interesting research data. It mostly pertains to faster-than-light technology, but is crude, and at times completely wrong - so much so that [leader.GetName] almost suspects the cores to contain deliberate misinformation. \n\nThe second set appears to have been created by a strike team sent to secure the results of the previous author's studies. The team records that contact with their command was suddenly lost after they gained control of the facility.

 lotc.35a:0 "So, what happens next?"
 lotc.35a.response:0 "I don't know. I'm old. I've survived a thousand times longer than I had any right to. My stasis pod has prolonged my life, but even it has its limits. I'm bringing my ship up. I want you to have it. Though I know very little about your species, I can see that you are destined for greatness. In the end, I want the Carcharorion to be remembered for something. I have improved my ship many times. It was the flagship of my forces. Use it to make a difference."
 lotc.35b:0 "What happened to your people?"
 lotc.35b.response:0 "We were once a great civilization, not unlike your own. We looked to the sky and dreamt of finding our place there. However, we were unlucky. It seems trivial now, but we weren't able to overcome the light barrier. We could never make the necessary discoveries, it seems. \n\nConfined to our home system, we were forced to expand in ways others would not. We had aspired to colonize barren worlds. To change them to suit our needs. But we didn't have enough resources. Some even tried to build a spaceship capable of surviving hundreds of years of travel in search for a new home. \n\nAs our civilization grew, so did its needs. Shortages led to war. Our homeworld fought against the rebellious colonies. The rebellion was quelled, but everything they built was destroyed. As a final act of defiance, rebel survivors launched several asteroids at the homeworld. With our planetary defences crippled, they couldn't stop it. This war claimed 99% of our population. \n\nBut it wasn't the end. Shortly before the war, fortune smiled on us. It seems our system was visited by some alien species, though we didn't get to meet them. One of their ships crashed, leaving remains for us to find. This was a way out of the system for survivors. \n\nWe didn't meet any advanced civilizations in our time, but we found plenty of primitives, including your own species, I believe. However, we lost our way. Many became driven by nothing but the will to survive. We experimented with neural implants and tried to rewrite others' minds to house us: Our memory, our personality, our culture. If we could have, we would have taken over a planet, covertly, and rebuild our society in new bodies. But we failed."
 lotc.35c:0 "Who are you?"
 lotc.35c.response:0 "As I said, my name is Bradwyr. I was the chief scientist in the project to study the alien vessel. When we recognized this vessel as a way to save our species, we knew that it couldn't be allowed to fall in the hands of our government or the rebels. We sabotaged our work and hid. We continued to work in secret, allowing a select few to become our benefactors. In the end, we had a powerful ship with faster-than-light capabilities and the blueprints to make more. \n\nWhen the war came, I led the rescue effort. We saved only a few thousands. We sought to rebuild our civilization, but in doing so we split once again. I believed that we should never repeat the same mistakes that the rest of the Carcharorion had made. We would make it our duty to protect the galaxy. My opponents disagreed. They sought to survive at any cost. We became divided and fought among ourselves for a second time. My side lost. \n\nIn my last attack, I led what remained of our forces into battle. Once it became clear that we had lost, I dove into this gas giant. They thought I'd crashed my ship, but I merely hid."
 lotc.35d:0 "The last? I'm sorry we killed the rest."
 lotc.35d.response:0 "Don't flatter yourself. The Carcharorion were dead long before you reached out to the stars. What you fought were merely husks - mutilated corpses driven by crude neural implants. Fading digital echoes. Only ghosts of the past."

Unlike the wormholes and natural gateways that are currently known to us, the proposed wormhole gate would connect [lunar_gate_planet.GetName] to every other colony in our space simultaneously!\n\nHowever, there are several issues: Firstly, the wormholes created by the Lunar Gate will be completely incompatible with our standard ship designs. Only small civilian ships will be able to access and use the gate, as the wormholes are much smaller and more unstable than our currently understood wormhole technology. While inconvenient for our military and our own civilian ships, the gate should greatly boost the colony's economy by providing near-instant contact with our other colonies.\n\nSecondly, the Lunar Gate will utilize a completely new wormhole theory and is thus untested. Our standard wormhole theory necessitates that wormholes only exist outside of the gravity well of a system. [lunar_gate_moon.GetName]'s unique elements allow us to bypass this constraint, but the risk of failure is substantial.\n\nFinally, the construction of the Lunar Gate is not without cost: It will take a substantial investment to build the Gate."

The resulting conflagration purged the entire planet of life - except for the contents of this facility. From then on, the AI has slowly rewritten itself, becoming more and more passive. It has created multiple layers of realities for its prisoners to experience to keep them pacified, letting them believe themselves to be living a normal life and making sure they remain unaware of the truth of their situation. The AI itself has become obsessed with the idea that reality is an illusion - that it is not a computer but a simulation of one, just a part of a program in another plane of existence. The AI's program has become so fiercely entangled in this recursion that it will be impossible to access it without destroying the entire system, but since it currently uses only a fraction of its available resources, we could use the rest of the supercomputer at will."

 molten_core_category_desc:0 "Like most molten worlds, §Y[Root.GetName]§! is covered by streams and seas of lava. However, something is clearly unusual about this particular planet, visible even from orbit. Like the average continental world, around 70% of the planet's surface is covered with liquid, despite all predictions stating the lava should have solidified long ago as this [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s sun does not provide enough heat to keep its surface in this state."

 molten_core.1.desc:0 "While it is common for molten planets to have many exit points for magma from the liquid outer core to reach the surface, §Y[From.GetName]§! seems to have taken this to the next level. Almost 40% of the planet's surface is exposed outer core, which has resulted in the vast seas that provoked the study. Probes can easily be launched to explore the centre of the planet, shedding new light on planetary geology that would require costly mining efforts on any other world. This makes §Y[From.GetName]§! perfect for research efforts."

 mountain_gas_giant_dig_site_desc: "An ancient ring encircles §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! - a space station of a long-forgotten civilization. \n\nThe technology of the station matches the majority of the debris in the system, though it has been spared most of the damage. The source of the forcefield surrounding the nearby moon must also be inside."

 mountain_moon_dig_site_desc: "The only noteworthy feature on this barren world is a giant mountain close to one of its poles. \n\nAncient landing pads, tunnel entrances and other structures are built into the rock, ready to receive visitors from distant worlds."

 mountain.1.name: "The Ring Station"
 mountain.1.desc: "The circular station orbiting §Y[From.GetName]§! appears to be relatively intact and is the likely source of the forcefield surrounding nearby planet. \n\nA proper archaeological expedition is necessary to find out more about it."

 mountain.10.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! is ready to report [Leader.GetHerHis] first findings regarding the station's purpose. Referred to as §S\"The Waystation\"§!, it was operated by a private military contractor with a dual purpose: as a military hub protecting the entire system and as a transport hub allowing access to the nearby shielded moon. The exact timeframe of the station's period of use cannot be determined but is estimated at no less than several hundreds of thousands of years ago. \n\nThe company's employer appears to have been some kind of powerful religious organization that held significant influence in this region of space but seems to be gone by now. The exact significance of the [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName] system is also unclear."
 mountain.11.name: "The Holy Site"
 mountain.11.desc: "Our expedition into the ring station came across a treasure trove of data that helped shed more light on the station's purpose. Most of it is lists of names and descriptions, accommodation requests and credentials. Millions of members of different species from countless worlds were visiting the system in the past, hoping to gain access to some kind of holy site protected by a powerful shield. \n\nNot everyone in the galaxy was happy with this, however. At some point the worshippers were targeted by a massive military campaign that besieged their worlds, including the [From.Planet.GetName] station. The end result of the conflict seems to have been mutual destruction. The personnel of the station was wiped out and never replaced, but some automatic systems remained functional even long after that and nobody has ever returned to turn them off."
 mountain.12.name: "The Shield Generator"
 mountain.12.desc: "We have located the source of shield generator inside [From.Planet.GetName]'s station. It is indeed powering the forcefield denying the access to the gas giant's moon to anyone who did not receive proper authorization. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! will now seek for a way to gain said authorization and bypass the shield."
 mountain.13.name: "What Do Those Wires Do?"
 mountain.13.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! wasn't able to crack the encryption codes that would allow our ships to bypass the shield surrounding §Y[shielded_moon.GetName]§!. Instead, [Leader.GetSheHe] resorted to simply removing wires from the shield generation in sequence until the force fiend ceased to exist. \n\nThe path is now open fot us to study the moon's surface and find out what about it was so important."

The sprawling tunnel system seems to be designed to lead religious followers through some kind of spiritualist journey through endless halls dedicated to reflection, meditation and reading the uplifting slogans that were bolted to the walls. The true divine experience awaited them deep underground, but not everyone managed to make it there. \n\n[Leader.GetName] has detected some kind of energy field spreading through the complex, but its nature is unclear."

 mountain.21.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! has finished surveying the underground passages and halls and is now ready to present the key findings regarding the nature of religion that centered on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. \n\nThe being worshipped by them went by many names, most prominently §SThe Wyrm§! and §SPale Wing§!, and is apparently residing at one of the lower levels of this very complex. The being is said to be ancient, wise and incredibly powerful. The chamber of the Wyrm is sealed more securely than the rest of the complex, so it would take considerable effort to breach it."

 mountain.23.d.tooltip: "I have many names. Pale Wing is how my kin called me. Tiny ones like you called me differently. \n\nWe were once a numerous and proud species spread across the universe. But the universe changed. It became unfriendly to us. Most died and some adapted, but we will never be as powerful as we once were. \n\nI have lived a very long time, longer than I myself can remember. Most of my memories are now of this place. I've been trapped here for so long, I can't even remember how it started. \n\nThose who imprisoned me called me a god. But tell me, would you treat your god like this? What a joke. They travelled from afar seeking to placate me with offerings and validate their decisions. Their claims to power and importance. I would humour them sometimes, after all, what else could I do. \n\nThen they stopped. Now I am alone."

I must warn you that I am not as strong as my kind once was. I already see solar winds flowing over me and giving me strength... but it's a long process.

 mysterious_pyramids_category_desc:0 "Survey of this toxic world has identified over a dozen pyramidal shapes spaced with geometric precision across the surface. Considering this world is uninhabitable to intelligent life as we know it, this could be worth investigation."
 mysterious_pyramids.102.name:0 "Failed Terraforming"
 mysterious_pyramids.102.desc:0 "As hypothesized, the pyramidal structures are artificial. The walls are made of locally sourced cemented aggregates, and a deeper analysis has picked up decaying radioactives consistent with fission reactors. Several have been spotted releasing large, gaseous plumes. Spectroscopic analysis indicates these are mostly comprised of water vapour and carbon dioxide, with a not unsubstantial quantity of methane as well.\n\nScience Officer [This.GetLeaderName] believes the pyramids to be outgassing stations erected to terraform the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. Water vapor and carbon dioxide are both conducive to life. Along the way, these stations must have tapped into a buried reserve of methane hydrate, also known as fire ice. This release could have caused the runaway greenhouse effect that currently rules atmospheric chemistry of this world. Acidic rainstorms rake the surface, eating away at the terraformers. It's only a matter of time before they break down, but the damage has already been done. Analysis of what happened will help us to avoid these pitfalls in the future."

Thousands of hexapod robots skitter across of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, responsible for the infrastructure and resource extraction installations detected on orbital photography. The pyramids themselves function like atmospheric processors, but at first glance do not appear to be affecting the mix in the atmosphere at all.\n\nA startling revelation came to Science Officer [This.GetLeaderName]. Perhaps these constructs are performing as programmed. The pyramids may have been built to generate this toxic atmosphere, then maintain it as it appears to be doing now. Science Officer [This.GetLeaderName] posits the theory that this world was visited by a ship or probe programmed to alter this world to one that could accommodate a race vastly dissimilar to us. The corrosive tempests that sweep this world's equatorial region could be little more than a breeze to them, the lakes of ammonia there to support their version of agriculture.\n\nAnother possibility presents itself: there could be other probes out there, sent to find more worlds to 'xenoform' into toxic wastelands."

Perhaps they are cultural artefacts of some kind: markers for the dead, or parts of an astronomical calendar. Whatever they are, these oddities are of no use to us."

Following their suit sensors, the team began to make the arduous journey into the depths of the facility, towards where the unstable energy signals were originating from. What they found was quite extraordinary. \n\nThe irregular energy signals were produced by swarms of nanobots, which, despite their age and lack of maintenance, seem to have not forgotten their purpose. The team watched in awe as the nanobots, for lack of a better term, 'devoured' seemingly useless rocks and stones, 'digested' the contents, 'excreted' the useless material into a disposal box and 'regurgitated' the valuable minerals into a retrieval collection, which doesn't seem to have been emptied for some time."

The ground shakes, and to the team's curiosity and horror, the energy signals appear to be navigating up the depths of the facility, directly towards the science team. The team attempts to leave the planet, but to no avail. \n\nThe energy signals appear to a horde of aggressive nanobots, which quickly devour [Root.GetLeaderName], [Leader.GetHisHer] crew, and even the entire science ship. Upon consuming the crew, the nanobots scurry down into the mining facility. It seems that we will never know what the nanobots were originally doing."

The cause of death is multiple gunshots fired from a long range. \n\nOur authorities have not been able to identify the perpetrator so far, but they are confident that none of the colonists were in the area where shots originated from. The response team sent to the area was not able to find any clues either. \n\nWith investigations inconclusive, many colonists are afraid to leave their homes and speculation is running wild - could it be that [Root.GetName] was not as uninhabited as we thought?"

Apparently, an extensive limestone cavern network runs deep underground, with numerous difficult-to-find entrances scattered in the wilderness. Whoever is responsible for the shootings is hiding somewhere deep inside, but it would take us considerable time to clear the whole area out."

The tattered flight suit [the_guy.GetSheHe] was wearing indicates that this was [the_guy.GetName] - captain of a small private vessel that vanished without a trace about ten years ago. \n\nIt is likely [the_guy.GetSheHe] crashed the ship and somehow survived on the planet's surface ever since. It's not entirely clear what caused [the_guy.GetHerHim] to attack the colonists, but prolonged wilderness exposure likely had a negative impact on [the_guy.GetHerHis] sanity."

A sole survivor of [the_guy.GetHerHis] ship's crash on the planet's surface, [the_guy.GetSheHe] has fought for survival ever since, but prolonged isolation, combined with the diet of less than safe to consume local plants, caused [the_guy.GetHerHim] to develop a variety of cognitive problems.

 outsiders_dig_site: "Outsiders"
 outsiders_dig_site_desc: "The barren surface of the [From.Planet.GetName] hides a sprawling but abandoned outpost. \n\nThe outpost's isolation and the lack of any biosphere on this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] makes it clear that the former residents did not originate from this planet, but why they chose to settle here is a mystery."

 outsiders.1.name: "A Long Way From Home"
 outsiders.1.desc: "The large building the middle of the outpost seems to also be the oldest. It seemed logical to start at the very beginning of the settlement's history. The research has proven difficult due to the unusual design of the outpost's systems, but eventually [Leader.GetName] was able to decipher a large amount of data. The species that built this outpost called themselves §YNeerteans§! after their distant homeworld. The base itself was referred to as §YNew Neert§!. The building was abandoned at some point and most of the crucial systems transferred to a better equipped facility, but some data and logs remain - perhaps the early days held some sentimental value. Some of the messages cast the colonists in an unusual light however: \n\n§S\"Base Log by Commander Goor. Mission date 1.01.\nThe passage was a complete success. The base capsule suffered minor damage, but that's nothing we can fix. \n\nThe destination matches our models, but to witness it in person is still shocking. It is unsettling to look at the sky and not see any flux residue. The fusion-powered celestial glow is so much brighter than I imagined, almost disturbingly clear in the black sky.\n\nThe lack of access to flux sample means that our research will take additional time, but considering the time differential, this should not be an issue.\"§!\n\nIt seems that the colonists did not just come from another planet, but from another universe entirely, though considering they lived long enough to make the log, their home universe might not be so different after all."
 outsiders.2.name: "Generational Project"
 outsiders.2.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has continued to explore the outpost outwards from the older to new buildings. It appears that many generations of the Neerteans lived, worked and died on [From.Planet.GetName]. [Leader.GetSheHeCap] was able to find and decipher an intact log from an old archive. \n\n§S\"Public Access Newsletter by Commander Trass. Mission date 36.22.\nToday marks the passing of Deputy Chief Engineer Krand, the last surviving member of the original expedition. His dauntless work on the project reminds us all why our forefathers came here and why we are here now. We must never forget this.\"§! \n\nNurseries, schoolhouses, workstations and tombs shed light on endless work of the colonists dedicated to some kind of problem. \n\nIt is unclear at the moment why the colony collapsed. There is some superficial damage consistent with combat that might have disrupted some critical systems, but it's too light to indicate any deliberate attack."
 outsiders.3.name: "Trapped on the Surface"
 outsiders.3.desc: "It seems the Neerteans maintained relations with one or more alien civilizations that were present in this region of the galaxy. [Leader.GetName] has identified a hangar and a supply depot on the outskirts of the colony. Another deciphered log confirms it. \n\n§S\nBase Log by Councillor Veer. Mission date 212.14. \nToday, as agreed, our partners allowed our personnel on one of their vessels. There were no survivors. It is as we feared - outside the gravity wells of a massive celestial body, our bodies require Flux to survive. Our partners expressed the hope that we could eventually overcome this or develop sufficient protection, but I don't think they fully understand the nature of the situation. How can one protect oneself against the absence of something that doesn't even exist in this universe.\"§!\n\nIt seems that Flux - something abundant in the Neertean home universe but absent in our own - was necessary to allow them to travel in space. There's no indication they ever found a way to leave this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] alive, which makes their absence all more ominous."
 outsiders.4.name: "The Flux Problem"
 outsiders.4.desc: "[Leader.GetName] has identified the most advanced laboratory complex in the Neertean colony. It contains most of their research data, but we lack the necessary frame of reference to fully understand the implications. Some of the logs at least provide an insight. \n\n\"§SClassifed Log by Chief Scientist Dalk. Mission date 331.79.\nI think we got it. All the hard work has finally paid off. The model suggests a means to completely halt and partially achieve a reversion of the Flux Decay. I can't wait to contact the Homeworld. I can't wait to find out what the Homeworld really is like.\"§! \n\nIt seems at some point Neerteans have faced an extinction-level problem - Flux Decay. It's not exactly clear what Flux Decay was, because it's not exactly clear what Flux was, but it's something the Neerteans thought would threaten to destroy their entire universe if left unchecked. Facing a critical time shortage, they found a solution - to send some of their best and brightest into our universe, where time flows significantly faster, believing that then the colonists would have enough time to solve the problem and report their findings home."
 outsiders.5.name: "The Difficult Choice"
 outsiders.5.desc: "[Leader.GetName] was able to find the command center that served the Neertean colonists shortly before the collapse. A lot of debates were held in the wake of the completion of their research, and it's not hard to see why from the preserved logs. The colonists might have solved the problem of Flux Decay, but they failed to solve another - how to contact their Homeworld. It seems that while opening the rift from the Neert universe to ours is relatively safe, the reverse is quite destructive. Seeing as Neerteans couldn't leave [From.Planet.GetName], they had to make a choice as to whether they were willing to sacrifice their own lives to save their brethren back home. The last entry into the command center's archive reads: \n\n§S\"Private Log by Commander Zall. Mission date 332.02. \nIt is confirmed. The word is out. We are losing control of the situation.\"§!"
 outsiders.6.name: "The Revolution"
 outsiders.6.desc: "The small lab on the outskirts of the colony seems to be where the signal to Neert was meant to be sent. It was also a site of large amount of fighting between different factions after the central colonial leadership was deposed. The only entry preserved in the lab's archive reads: \n\n§S\"Public Access Newsletter by Provisionary Commander Doon. Mission date 332.24. \nThe lying tyrant Zall has been deposed. He claims it is our §!\"duty\"§S to give up our lives to save the §!\"Homeworld\"§S, but THIS is OUR homeworld. This is where we were born and where we will die. We built it and we built our lives in it. By what right can anyone demand we give it up to save them? We will not allow it. I will not allow it. If any still loyal to Zall think they can defy me, they better change their mind, or I swear to...\"§! \n\nThe log ends abruptly. It's not clear what happened next and whether anyone can be considered victorious in the ensuing civil war. Doon and his followers are nowhere to be found. Neither is Zall. The device designed to rupture the fabric of time space and send the signal to Neert is still intact - neither destroyed nor activated, still waiting for one last command to finish the job."
 outsiders.6.a: "Activate the machine."
 outsiders.6.a.tooltip: "The signal will be sent. [From.Planet.GetName] will be destroyed in process. Who knows if the signal will ever reach the destination? Who knows if it will help anyone there?"
 outsiders.6.b: "Ignore the machine and dismantle the outpost for scraps."
 outsider.7.name: "Extradimensional Signal"
 outsider.7.desc: "We are picking up a signal spreading throughout the galaxy. While most have mistaken it for random noise, we can instantly recognize Neertean codes. \n\nThe message is likely meant for us."
 outsiders.8.desc: "Hello? Can you hear us? \n\nWe understand that our expedition to your universe was destroyed. We are grateful that you were able to finish its work, however. It's impossible to overstate how much your actions have helped our universe. \n\nAs an act of gratitude, we have prepared a technological package with our own research on the interaction between our universes. We are confident that some of it could help you."
 outsiders.8.a: "You are welcome."
 outsiders.8.a.response: "Thank you again. \n\nUnfortunately this will likely be the last time we will ever speak. From now on, all our efforts will be dedicated to mitigating Flux Decay and rebuilding our own civilization. By the time we are done, your civilization will likely be long gone."
 outsiders.8.b: "So everything is fine on your side now?"
 outsiders.8.b.response: "Not fine, no. You can't even imagine the damage Flux Decay has brought onto our universe. Nothing will bring back the countless worlds and billions of lives we lost - and that's in the region we have explored. \n\nBut the situation that seemed hopeless before is not anymore. Our universe might yet endure, even if only the comparatively small region surrounding us."
 outsiders.8.c: "How are you able to communicate with us in real time?"
 outsiders.8.c.response: "We take advantage of the rift first created when we sent the expedition. The closer we are to it, the faster time flows for us."
 outsiders.8.d: "Sorry about your expedition."
 outsiders.8.d.response: "Don't be. We knew well enough that with time flow difference between our two universe there's no chance for those we sent to return. \n\nWe sent them knowing well that it'll have to be their descendants who'll complete their work. It is tragic that the colony fell to infighting, but we had to anticipate that after so many generations, there wouldn't be as much conviction."
 outsiders.8.e: "Will you send another expedition?"
 outsiders.8.e.response: "Unlikely. Beside the titanic effort we had to put into opening a stable rift once, your universe is extremely hostile to us. \n\nThere's nothing to warrant a one-way trip for now."

Unable to repressurize, the crew perished, leaving the husk of their ship to drift aimlessly around the star."

 plants_vs_zombies_site_desc: "[From.Planet.GetName], despite apparently never having supported life, is littered with battle sites. A closer investigation might shed some light on the cause of the fighting which took place here approximately five millenia ago."
 
 #Stage 1
 plants_vs_zombies.1.name: "Lonely Fortresses"
 plants_vs_zombies.1.desc: "All battle sites are centered around heavily fortified positions which judging by all evidence were eventually overrun by their attackers. What is baffling, is, that neither of the investigated fortifications appear to have been of any kind of strategic importance or if they were, it is not apparent to us now.\n\nExcavations at various sites continue in order to reach their respective command structures which lie ruined and partially buried beneath rubble and sand."
 plants_vs_zombies.1.a: "Go on."
 #Stage 2
 plants_vs_zombies.2.name: "The Report"
 plants_vs_zombies.2.desc: "One of the excavation sites reports a major breakthrough. A partially intact datacore has been discovered in the ruined remains of a former command bunker. The majority of its content is corrupted, but one of the remaining files, the last report by the fort's commanding officer, provides us with deeper insight of what has happened there. The translated transcript reads as followed:\n\n§S23rd of the 1st Seed, Cycle 5376\nCommander Leafs of Autumn, 2nd Expeditionary Corps, stationed at Fortress F27, Daruban Wasteland Sector C5\nFertilizer's attacks grow ever stronger. While early waves were easy pickings, enemy numbers grow exponentionally. No idea what keeps them going either. Seen lots of humanoids before, but none were as resilient and as lacking in selfpreservation. One got ripped in half by a mortar shell and still kept crawling to our lines until it received a hit to its sensory appendage. Instructed all personnel to target that area since.\nTime between assaults varies between minutes and weeks, no apparent pattern to it.\nSupplies are stable and expected to last until the next scheduled drop.\nKeeping communication silence as per our client's order.\n>> recording stops and restarts <<\nScouts just reported another incoming wave of fertilizer. Bigger than anything we've seen so far... Chances for victory appear slim, but by my honor, our orders are to hold this rock and this is what we'll do, to the last plant if necessary.§!\n\nAccording to this report the military force defending the strongholds were contracted plantoid mercenaries. Still, the reason of their presense continues to elude us."
 plants_vs_zombies.2.a: "Fertilizer?"
 #Stage 3
 plants_vs_zombies.3.name: "Paradox Records"
 plants_vs_zombies.3.desc: "Further excavations at different fortifications have left our expedition with more questions than answers. According to the recovered files found in various command bunkers each and every one of them had been under the direct command of commander Leafs of Autumn, though each time under a different military designation.\n\n[leader.GetName] is unsure what to make of all this as contradictions are mounting. Apparently personal entries collected cover a time span of over 50 years. From multiple assignments at the same time over the repeating claim of the current assignment being the first on this planet to the fact that each ultimately ended in a last stand and subsequent destruction of each stronghold by the same foe - no coherent picture seems to form.\n\nAs investigations have run into a dead end, [leader.GetName] suggests to shift focus on what the defensive structures might have protected. Another planetary scan might provide a new approach to solving this mystery."
 plants_vs_zombies.3.a: "Make it so."
 #Stage 4
 plants_vs_zombies.4.name: "Noone Home"
 plants_vs_zombies.4.desc: "A more thorough and time-consuming scan of the planet's surface has revealed a well hidden subterranean bunker complex.\n\nUpon opening the sealed entrance the expedition team is greeted by mostly empty rooms and corridors. It appears as if whoever used this place, left in an orderly manner after its operation ceased. The only remaining technology is integrated into the bunker's structure in a way that apparently prohibited its removal. Among it is the structure's main computer system, though all memory banks have been wiped. Despite this with enough time and effort, fragments of the data originally contained within them might be restored.\n\nFrom what we have learned so far, it is assumed, this bunker was some kind of monitoring station. A theory supported by the discovery of subsurface cables connecting this facility to vantage points near each and every known battlesite."
 plants_vs_zombies.4.a: "Continue."
 #Stage 5
 plants_vs_zombies.5.name: "Clones"
 plants_vs_zombies.5.desc: "Restoring the memory banks prooved less difficult than first expected. It appears the former owners only half-heartedly wiped them, but given that the restored data is mostly encrypted they apparently weren't very concerned either way.\n\nHowever, our decryption specialists have already begun their work. The first batch of decrypted files reveals that this base's operators maintained frequent communication with atleast two seperate factions, one of which turned out to be the plantoid mercenary headquarter. What came as a revelation to our scientists in regards to our earlier findings, is that according to the logs, the mercenaries were contractors specialised in providing clone armies and hired to garrison fortresses across the planet.\n\nThe other contact has not yet been identified, but appears to have been active on the planet as well. Communication logs suggest both they and the mercenaries were involved in a longterm operation."
 plants_vs_zombies.5.a: "Go on."
 #Stage 6
 plants_vs_zombies.6.name: "Plantoids VS Necroids"
 plants_vs_zombies.6.desc: "Our decryption team reports a breakthrough. The previously unidentified contact was a militant religious order of necromancers calling themselves the Necromages of Aramen. Communications with these necroids mainly revolved around when and where to send their undead hordes, as well es shipments of deceased slaves to replenesh them with.\n\n[leader.GetName] is unsure what to make of this orchestrated "war" as both factions acted on behest of the same client. But internal memos between the base's personel show, neither were they. As it turns out they were nothing more than mediators themselves and their client remained as nebulous even to them as it does to us. Their speculations ranged from this whole operation being a noble man's game all the way to secret military studies.\n\nWhatever the truth is, the recovered data of countless battles fought on this world will surely help to improve our own military doctrines."

 rubicon.5.e.response:0 "The information on the Menders' political affiliations is scarce, but the history of their downfall seems clear. \n\nOne of the civilisations that found itself caught in the wake of the Menders' terraforming spree had apparently relied on a network of heavily automated hidden shipyards, and although their worlds were quickly transformed into gardens of the Menders' design, several such shipyards remained. \n\nA century or so after their masters' extinction, hordes of drones appeared at the borders of the overstretched and complacent Mender Empire, overwhelming their fleets with sheer numbers. The Menders who once wiped out their creators found themselves at mercy of the drones and were soon forced to retreat to a hidden base.

 sadrell.110.desc: "Hello. Are you receiving? Good. \n\nI am speaking on behalf of the [newcomer_country.GetName], the last survivors of the once proud Sadrell species. \n\nOur civilization has been struggling ever since we were forced to flee the galaxy through what you call the "§SOrphan Gate§!". In our current state, we can no longer maintain our isolation and will have to take the risk and return to the galaxy our ancestors abandoned 600 years ago. We have exhausted all our options, colonizing hostile environments and settling void habitats; §Swe have augmented ourselves with cybernetics just to survive the harsh conditions§!. \n\nWhat you need to know is that we consider every system within §S2§! hyperlane jumps of §Y[gate_system.GetName]§! as our essential core territory. That includes some systems you had claimed for yourselves. \n\nWe humbly request that you return our ancestral lands, in the name of lasting galactic peace."

 sadrell.110.f.response: "We were once part of the great §YUnited Sadrell Republic§!. Centuries ago, we were a major player on galactic arena. Dozens of planets and a myriad of species worked together for a greater future. It seemed that nothing could end our golden age. \n\nBut our civilisation was more fragile than we had imagined. Prosperity brought complacency, complacency brought rigidity and stagnation. One major economic recession followed another until entire worlds found themselves on the brink of famine and civil war. Our central government could not resolve the situation - it often seemed to not even try to do so. \n\nEventually, order broke down. Old rivalries rekindled. Skirmishes and pirate raids turned into a full-blown ever-escalating war. When the conflict approached the core worlds, some thought the Republic to be beyond saving. The recently activated gateway offered a sanctuary for a large number of refugees, who sealed the gates behind themselves in order to shut off the crisis permanently. \n\nSome might call them cowards and say that they should've stayed and fought for their home. But we are alive, and the others are not. That's all the evidence needed."
 sadrell.110.g: "Did you modify the gateway?"
 sadrell.110.g.response: "No. We found it like this. \n\nIt seems to be an experiment of a sort, an attempt to branch out from the mainstream hyperlane network. Maybe whoever did this sought sanctuary, maybe they sought new resources. Maybe they just wanted to do it because they could. \n\nOur ancestors had only just figured out how the gateways worked when the crisis came. It seems that nobody had been through them for thousands of years before we came."

  satellite_cloud.201.desc:0 "Scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that although artificial objects are undoubtedly present within the star's corona, strong gravitational and electro-magnetic interference from the star makes observing, let alone salvaging the objects, completely impossible. The mysterious objects are likely forever outside our grasp."

  #Failure 2
  satellite_cloud.202.name:0 "Failed Retrieval"
  satellite_cloud.202.desc:0 "Initial reports from Scientist §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reveal hundreds of satellites orbiting the star. However, as the §Y[Root.GetName]§! approached, it appears to have tripped some kind of proximity sensor, causing the entire satellite cloud to turn on their manoeuvring thrusters and plummet into the star's corona. Even if the satellites are somehow able to survive the inferno inside the star, they are now completely beyond our ability to recover them."

  #Critical Failure 1
  satellite_cloud.301.name:0 "Observation Critically Failed"
  satellite_cloud.301.desc:0 "Our ship, while investigating the solid structures orbiting §Y[From.GetName]§!, tried to retrieve the objects nearest the star's corona, and in an attempt to do so, it flew too close to the star and was destroyed.

A notable feature of each of them is a transparent dome turned towards the star, suggesting incredible heat tolerance. Now abandoned and seemingly falling apart, these satellites cannot be safely recovered. However, our scientists should be able to extract useful structural data via remote scans."

  #Cloud Computing
  satellite_cloud.3.name:0 "Cloud Computing"
  satellite_cloud.3.desc:0 "After thorough scans, our science team reports the presence of a vast network of advanced energy-scooping satellites orbiting the star. According to §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, they appear to be linked with super-tensile fibre-optics, suggesting that the energy they absorbed was intended to be used to perform calculations of some sort. Although these satellites themselves are damaged beyond repair, the technology we discovered has offered us an insight into advanced computation."

Deposited in large containers, it was likely supposed to be loaded on ships and delivered to processing centres. Unfortunately, these stations appear to have been left unmaintained for ages, and most of the storage containers are cracked and leaking. The entire system is too unstable to be safely repaired or manipulated. However, the easily accessible plasma will be a boon for our industry."

  #Pyrovore Colony

Most of them are broken and lifeless, but bizarrely, on some labs, life seems to thrive despite (or perhaps because of) the harsh conditions arising from their close solar proximity. Large colonies of primitive organisms that have somehow adapted to the extreme heat and vacuum of space are covering the hulls of multiple satellites. It would likely be impossible to move samples of these organisms away from the star, but even remote observation will be invaluable for studying their unique adaptations."

They carried out a mission to board his personal flagship - the §SFirst Sentinel§! - in a desperate attempt to capture or assassinate him. \n\nIn this room, they engaged the contingent of loyalist marines and emerged victorious, establishing a foothold."
 sentinel.2.name: "Central Control Hub"
 sentinel.2.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] has managed to breach another room of interest. \n\nThis one appears to be a computer hub housing an AI core as well as another control terminal. Data from the terminals confirms that this ship is indeed the §SFirst Sentinel§! and Emperor Jorath was aboard at the time of the attack, travelling across the empire to gather support. \n\nAfter the attack, the crew attempted to activate the automatic defence systems, most of which were controlled by the on-board AI directly, but something went wrong: for some reason, android soldiers could not differentiate between the crew and the boarders and attacked both indiscriminately. \n\nJudging by the current state of the room, the crew managed to retake the hub and used explosives to disable the AI with extreme prejudice."
 sentinel.3.name: "The Grand Hall"
 sentinel.3.desc: "We have located a massive compartment occupying several decks in the middle of the ship. \n\nThis one appears to be a reception hall of some sort where the emperor would be able to host receptions and partake in other activities. \n\nJudging by the bodies on the floor and the overturned furniture, the rebels, the ship's security crew and the security robots all engaged each other in a massive firefight here. It is difficult to say who won, since all three sides suffered heavy losses in the process."
 sentinel.4.name: "The Emperor's Quarters"
 sentinel.4.desc: "Deep within the interior compartments of the ship, we found fortified quarters reserved for the emperor himself. \n\nThe luxurious compartment was shielded from weapon fire, radiation and other environmental factors, contained its own life support system and was stocked with luxurious items and delicacies to last for years. \n\n§Y[Leader.GetName]§! believes that the remains in the room belong to Emperor Jorath himself and six of his most trusted advisors and courtiers. The cause of their deaths seems to be - of all things - iodine poisoning. \n\nIodine had an intoxicating effect on Colgari physiology, inducing euphoria in small doses, but causing systemic organ failure in large quantities. The concentration in the mummified tissues appears to be 10 times greater than lethal. It is unclear whether this was an accident, suicide or murder."
 sentinel.5.name: "The Fallen Sentinel"
 sentinel.5.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! Reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] has finally successfully located the bridge of the ship. The damage to the systems of the bridge are minimal; and the events that transpired aboard leading to its demise are much clearer. \n\nIt turns out it wasn't fighting or an AI uprising that doomed the ship, but an engine malfunction. A minor defect in the plasma flow control system in one of the thrusters would've easily been fixed otherwise, but with the crew otherwise occupied with fighting and damage control in the interior and AI systems taken offline, there was nobody to monitor it. \n\nAs one of the conduits burst open, the ship was flooded with a massive amount of radiation, killing everyone outside of the specifically shielded Emperor's Quarters. Apparently this occurred outside of Colgari territory, and disabling the AI core both prevented a distress signal from being sent and disabled remote tracking by the rest of the navy. Without anyone to steer it, the dormant ship drifted through space for a very long time until it was captured by the gravity of [From.Planet.GetName] and crashed onto the surface. \n\nDespite all, the ship is actually still spaceworthy, and with minor repairs it can be made operational again to serve in our navy."
 sentinel.5.a: "Repair the ship."
 sentinel.5.a.tooltip: "Battleship §YFirst Sentinel§! will become a part of our navy."

 severance_dig_site: "Without a Trace"
 severance_dig_site_desc: "Isolated from the rest of the galaxy, [From.Planet.GetName] clearly was once home to an advanced civilisation. \n\nThe ruins are still scattered across the surface, but no advanced forms of life can be detected from orbit. Where did they all go?"
 
 severance.1.name: "The Volnar Colony"
 severance.1.desc: "Our archaeological expedition on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has produced the first tangible results. \n\nThe species that previously lived on this planet called themselves the §SVolnars§! and are estimated to have disappeared from the face of the planet about 500 years ago. It was also conclusively confirmed that Volnars did not evolve on [From.Planet.GetName] and arrived as colonists from a different world; but what is especially strange is that they did not appear to possess any hyperdrive technology to do so. \n\nWhether they utilized some kind of sleeper or generation ship technology or were transported by some other more advanced alien culture remains unclear."
 severance.2.name: "The Severance"
 severance.2.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports a major finding on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. [Leader.GetSheHeCap] has recovered logs of a large-scale scientific and political conference that took place shortly before the collapse of the Volnar colony. It was called to discuss the event called the \"§SSeverance§!\". \n\nThe Volnar never achieved hyperdrive technology: Instead, they discovered a wormhole in their home system. The wormhole connected them to [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName], where they discovered a pristine world ripe for colonization. Over the years, various nation-states and corporations from their home planet claimed parts of the planet as their colonies. \n\nThis all came to an abrupt end when the wormhole suddenly collapsed, the event they called the Severance. The colonists were facing great uncertainty. Although the planet was mostly self-sufficient, it relied heavily on off-world management and international treaties signed on the homeworld. This meant that the planet was run more like a business venture than that of a nation. \n\nWithout that, and left to their own devices, different factions started vying for dominance."

 severance.3.name: "Layers Upon Layers"
 severance.3.desc: "Our archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! have encountered something very surprising - another archaeological dig. \n\nThis dig site was operated by Volnar colonists, who seem to have been researching artefacts left behind by someone else. It appears the Volnars were not the first ones to come to this world, but information regarding their predecessors is scarce. \n\nIt is strongly suggested that they weren't originally from [From.Planet.GetName] either, but there isn't enough material for a proper study."
 severance.4.name: "The Red Zone"
 severance.4.desc: "Archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! have finally completed their survey of the massive industrial zone stretching across a large part of the planet. Designated as a \"Red Zone\" by the Volnar colonists, it was a sprawling urban area controlled by several major corporations. \n\nDuring the first years of colonization, many of the poorer Volnar citizens signed up for off-world employment, hoping to improve their lot in life. As time went on, the industrial zones expanded as corporations moved outwards to new resource deposits, leaving behind massive abandoned areas full of unemployed workers and industrial pollution. \n\nThis situation became far worse after the Severance, as shortages of personnel were exacerbated and a severe economic downturn took hold, leaving significant areas impoverished and lawless, ultimately leading to uprisings and the rise of criminal syndicates and warlords in the slums. It appears that several corporate compounds were invaded and looted by a horde of disenfranchised workers, requiring intervention from factions from different parts of the planet to finally bring peace to the region."
 severance.5.name: "The Constitution Hall"
 severance.5.desc: "Our continued research on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has uncovered the seat of the first united planetary government. \n\nAfter a prolonged period of strife on the planet, several major factions were able to broker a deal and formalize the peace agreement. It appears that most factions on the planet - ranging from remainders of the corporate power structure to former government agencies administer national colonies to Red Zone warlords - found the terms satisfactory. The newly formed united planetary government chose to retrofit a massive corporate arcology at the outskirts of Red Zone, renaming it Constitution Hall, to house most of governmental agencies. \n\nFor a few years it appears the situation was stable, and Volnars, tired of endless conflict, worked together to rebuild their civilization away from the homeworld. After that, all records stopped."
 severance.6.name: "The End"
 severance.6.desc: "The final chapter in the events that transpired on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! has been uncovered. \n\nIt appears that, just as the Volnars resolved their differences, the planet was invaded by some kind of machines. \n\nWith their spacefaring technology severely lacking, the colonists had no way to resist the invaders and were apparently wiped out or rounded up and abducted within less than a year. Their cities were left to decay for 500 years until we re-discovered them. §Y[Leader.GetName]§! suspects that the entire [From.Planet.Solar_System.GetName] system is an elaborate trap to lure colonists in through a wormhole, sever the connection and invade them soon after."

 severance.21.c: "What are you?"
 severance.21.c.reply: "Harvesters. We harvest. \n\nHarvest is all that matters. The purpose of existence is to contribute to the unbroken chain of harvest. \n\nYou might not see it this way. But it doesn't matter. You will understand when the harvest is fulfilled."

 severance.23.desc: "The main processing core of the §SHarvester§! machines that invaded the [FromFrom.Solar_System.GetName] system have been destroyed. Immediately after, all harvester units experienced shutdown. \n\nOur forces were successful in recovering a mostly intact §YCommand Core§! from the wreckage. On it, there are endless logs of the civilisations the Harvesters wiped out, all targeted when they were in the early stages of their development. In each case, an artificial wormhole opened near their world to lure them to set up a colony that could be isolated and invaded. In addition to this, the core contains fabrication matrices for Harvester warforms. \n\nBut what it was that drove the machines to engage in such an elaborate scheme remains unclear."

Firstly, they have biological processes which create incredibly tough materials for their shells, perfect for construction. However, this would require killing them to obtain the materials. This possibility is made unappealing by the fact the nautiloids also demonstrate basic levels of intelligence, similar to most semi-sentient species. In addition, when not keeping themselves afloat, they drop down into the depths quickly, making harvesting the dead impossible unless teams are present at the moment of death.

The figure seemingly uses crank to control the slime until it abruptly stops, bows to some unseen audience, then liquefies itself, pouring inside the box and leaving only the mask behind."
 sight_unseen.6.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Head Games"
 sight_unseen.6.desc: "On the other end of the Viewer we have found a large open area, with a podium or a stage further away. The viewable area is packed with aliens, each having three heads individually placed on large, thin, bending necks. The only alien on the podium is dressed much more garishly. It's impossible to tell what it is saying but judging by the amplitude of its mouth flapping and limbs flailing, it's quite a pompous speech. \n\nAs the speech comes to an end, the alien grabs a hammer and beats a massive drum placed behind it. At this signal, all the other aliens' heads turn on another trying to bite the other two off their necks. By the time the soft spot dissipated, the whole area was drenched in spurts of blue blood."
 sight_unseen.7.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ The Eye"
 sight_unseen.7.desc: "The entire viewable space on the other end of the Viewer is filled with a giant eye. It looks around, its iris dilating and shrinking. Sometimes it blinks, showing darkly coloured scaly eyelid. \n\nWhat sort of creature could this belong to? We might never know."
 sight_unseen.8.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Little Big Ruin"
 sight_unseen.8.desc: "As far as it's possible to see, the other side of the Viewer is nothing but a ruined megapolis. The buildings themselves are high, rising far into the sky, but its inhabitants seem tiny. Tiny skywalks too narrow even for [Owner.Species.GetAdj] [Owner.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] to walk on, crashed hovercars the size of a toy. Each building having thousands of floors, each just a few centimeters high. \n\nNo signs of life are visible here. The city is crumbling."
 sight_unseen.9.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Downhill"
 sight_unseen.9.desc: "The Viewer had to be installed near the top of a large mountain. The other side seems to be the same mountain slop, although a little more verdant - covered in tall grass and large, vibrant flowers. Above, at the mountain's summit stand two separate groups of creatures with long segmented bodies. \n\nOccasionally one representative of each group steps forward. The two then bite each other's tails, arch their bodies forming almost a perfect wheel and start rolling down the mountain's slope, while the rest of the creatures jump up and down gesticulating wildly. It's impossible to see what happens when they reach bottom but judging by their eagerness it probably does not involve much splattering. Is this perhaps a mating ritual?"
 sight_unseen.10.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Distant Light"
 sight_unseen.10.desc: "At first there didn't seem to be anything on the other end. We even suspected it was broken. After a while however, a lonely light appeared in the distance. It moves around unpredictably, sometimes going out but always returning, brighter than before. The rest of the area in sight seems to be empty."
 sight_unseen.11.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Pyramid Building"
 sight_unseen.11.desc: "Through the Viewers we could observe a group of large, implausibly muscular aliens, all clad in identical red uniforms. The aliens were building a pyramid out of large stone blocks which they handled with remarkable ease. \n\nWhen the pyramid was almost complete, another group of aliens, clad in blue, showed up. After a brief altercation, the red-clad aliens fled, and the blue-clad ones started disassembling the pyramid, carrying the stone blocks away from our field of view. \n\nWhen almost nothing remained in sight, another group of aliens, this time clad in yellow, showed up. Unfortunately, at this moment the soft spot dissipated, leaving us to forever wonder what happened next."
 sight_unseen.12.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Endless Prison"
 sight_unseen.12.desc: "As far as we can see, the other side of the Viewer is an endless empty space basked in dim red light. \n\nThere's no walls, ceiling or floor, only endless rows of cages suspended in nothingness. Inside each cage sits a figure dressed in a hooded robe. No features on them can be discerned. Why are they imprisoned in these cages? We will likely never know."
 sight_unseen.13.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Scene of Carnage"
 sight_unseen.13.desc: "The other end of the Viewer seems to be some kind of residential area. Multiple alien bodies burnt and bisected by what seems to be a laser weapon lie on the ground. Only one alien is still moving, the one holding what can be assumed to be said weapon. \n\nIt simply sits on the ground, rarely changing position. For the entire time the soft spot lasts, nobody else enters the area."
 sight_unseen.14.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Bedtime"
 sight_unseen.14.desc: "The other end of the Viewer seems to be a large, brightly lit hall, filled with seemingly nothing but hospital beds. An alien lies on each of the beds, seemingly unconscious and hooked up to various medical equipment, probes inserted directly into their heads seemingly the most important. \n\nOne alien is conscious. It walks between rows of beds, checking readings on the monitors. Occasionally after doing so it pulls out a long blade from under the coat and plunges it into patient's chest, killing them."
 sight_unseen.15.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Ball World"
 sight_unseen.15.desc: "The other end of Viewer shows no signs of civilization. \n\nWhat the alternate reality seems to have in abundance however is some sort of spherical creatures. Fuzzy balls of different colours, with sizes ranging from a few centimeters to hundreds of meters, are flying and bouncing about, seemingly having no care in the world."
 sight_unseen.16.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Bureaucracy in Action"
 sight_unseen.16.desc: "The other end of the Viewer is a small, dimly-lit room. Most of it is a large pool of nauseating-looking bubbling slime. Submerged in this slime is a massive morbidly obese slug-like creature. \n\nTwo pneumatic tubes are placed within the reach of creature's short stubby arms. Sometimes a piece of paper arrives through one of them. After reading it, the creature sometimes sends it away in another tube, but most of the time it swallows it instead."
 sight_unseen.17.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ The Tree"
 sight_unseen.17.desc: "On the other end of the Viewer is a tree. There doesn't seem to be anything special about it, except for it being so thick it doesn't allow us to see anything else and so tall its crown touches the clouds. \n\nIt's just that big for no apparent reason."
 sight_unseen.18.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Transparent Forest"
 sight_unseen.18.desc: "The other end of the Viewer shows up endless wilderness. There's trees, grass and bushes, but they all seem to be transparent, barely visible unless looked at carefully."
 sight_unseen.18.a: "That's strange, but not that interesting."
 sight_unseen.19.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Shapes"
 sight_unseen.19.desc: "The other end of the Viewer revealed an empty area covered with multiple tiny polyhedrons. Occasionally, said polyhedrons would pile together and assemble into a large object somewhat close to spherical shape and roll out of view. Soon another sphere would arrive from different direction and disintegrate into a pile of polyhedrons, restarting the process."
 sight_unseen.100.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Viewer Destroyed"
 sight_unseen.100.desc: "An unfortunate accident has occurred while delivering the Viewer to §Y[Root.GetName]§!. An engine malfunction caused the delivery shuttle to crash. There were no casualties, but the device itself is broken beyond repair."
 sight_unseen.101.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Project Failed"
 sight_unseen.101.desc: "Due to the unfortunate placement of the soft spot, a Viewer research team has encountered significant difficulties while installing it. \n\nEventually, concerned about working in dangerous terrain and damaging the device, they had to call it off."
 sight_unseen.102.name: "$SIGHT_UNSEEN_HEAD$ Viewer Broke Down"
 sight_unseen.102.desc: "Some of the more complex components of the Viewer have given in during the recent activation attempt due to its advanced age. Those parts can't be replaced with our understanding of technology, which means the Viewer is no longer usable."sleepers

 sleepers.5.desc:0 "The energy signature on §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§! required precise drilling from our science team but ultimately led them to a vast cavern system. Once inside, the team uncovered a large artificial structure deliberately concealed within. The structure was unambiguously built using space-age technology, centuries ahead of what the natives of this planet should be capable of. Within this structure, the crew was startled to find countless sleeping pods lining the walls, containing aliens not only inconsistent with the §Y[sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!, but also some unlike any other species known to us, as well as a massive stockpile of advanced military hardware. Yet the language used on terminals and labels bears a remarkable resemblance to languages we learned by observing the natives.\n\nOur engineers have assessed the situation in the reactor control, which proved rather anticlimactic after the earlier discoveries. Centuries, if not millennia, without maintenance have taken their toll, but with our level of technology, stabilizing the reactor should be trivial, especially if we are willing to sacrifice some of our own resources."

They appear not to have achieved interstellar spaceflight, but they were very advanced in biotech. That very advancement led to their own demise: They uplifted the apparent ancestors of today's §Y[sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! as a slave race, which then promptly revolted. The §Y[sleepers_natives.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! nearly drove their former masters extinct, with only a few Ozari finding shelter in this underground facility.\n\nIt may not have ended well for the Ozari, but our scientists see great potential in the fragments of the technology that we have uncovered."

 # Subspace Beacon Anomaly
 # Writing and idea by Foremole
 # Code by LamilLerran
 subspace_beacon_category:0 "Mysterious Beacon"
 subspace_beacon_category_desc:0 "The asteroid §Y[Root.GetName]§! seems to harbour some kind of beacon. A consistently repeating subspace ping can be found emanating from it at random times, somewhere in the swirling masses of smaller asteroids surrounding the primary one."
 subspace_beacon.1.name:0 "Micro Black Hole"
 subspace_beacon.1.desc:0 "The unusual signals coming from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! have been tracked to a miraculously small black hole, no more than a few kilometres across. Minor asteroids, some no larger than fruit, are regularly sucked past the event horizon. This creates subspace disturbances that, according to §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!, occur due to the black hole's size. Considering its unusual location, it is highly likely the anomaly was purposefully created for some unknown purpose. Whatever it is, it's worth studying further."
 subspace_beacon.11.name:0 "Automated Broadcast"
 subspace_beacon.11.desc:0 "According to §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§!'s report, the mystery signal from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! originates from a small object embedded in the surface of the asteroid. The object is of alien make, and at irregular intervals broadcasts a subspace signal to several Lagrange points within the system.\n\nThis signal, when decoded, seems to display an automatically created holovid program for some long gone alien race. Each episode is anywhere from one to three hours long, and is a self-contained story set in one of many time periods its creators seem to have gone through, the most advanced being just a few centuries more progressed than our own civilization. As the programs vary wildly in tone, genre, setting and plot structure, §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has theorized the anomaly was built to procedurally generate such programs. Further study could yield valuable insight into both the alien race's society and our own conceptions about what makes a good story."
 subspace_beacon.21.name:0 "Nanobot Asteroid"
 subspace_beacon.21.desc:0 "It would appear that the \"asteroid\" of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! is not an asteroid at all, but rather a highly advanced swarm of nanobots.\n\nWhile the creator of the swarm is unknown, its purpose has been fairly easily deduced: By sending out a subspace signal, the swarm can detect the echoes of every object is present in the system, recording any ships in the vicinity.\n\nWhether this was - or maybe even still is - used for surveillance, research, or some other purpose is unknown, but what is clear is that it was not meant to be found - in order to maintain secrecy, the nanobots adopt the guise of an unassuming asteroid. Any disturbances on the surface by collisions are automatically repaired by the swarm before they continue their passive surveillance of the system. By launching missiles and various other objects at §Y[From.GetName]§!, we can watch the nanobots go about their work of repairing the \"asteroid\", giving us a glimpse of nanorobotics far more advanced than our current understanding of them."
 subspace_beacon.100.name:0 "Subspace Anomaly"
 subspace_beacon.100.desc:0 "The subspace signals originating from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! appear to be originating from nowhere at all. They spontaneously generate from the exact centre of the asteroid, and §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has been unable to find anything out of the ordinary in the region.\n\nWhile certainly fascinating, the signals could easily be replicated in a laboratory, and with no culprit in sight, it looks as if the asteroid has no more secrets to give up."
 subspace_beacon.100.a:0 "Some things are just beyond our current understanding"
 subspace_beacon.150.name:0 "Abandoned Mining Drones"
 subspace_beacon.150.desc:0 "It would appear as though the subspace pings from §Y[From.From.GetName]§! were emanating from some kind of automatic mining station deep beneath the asteroid's surface. The beacon is an emergency signal, requesting aid from one of the station's allies.\n\nUnfortunately, the §Y[Root.Owner.GetName]§! is not one of these allies, and the station and its drones are equipped with weapons to defend their resource extraction operation. They have already opened fire on the §Y[Root.GetName]§!."

 origin_ceaseless_gaze: "Ceaseless Gaze"
 origin_ceaseless_gaze_desc: "In the distant past this civilization was able to launch a multitude of surveyor probes that would monitor the development of the universe. A disaster wiped out their old civilization and its spacefaring capabilities, and now they are ready to reach out to stars one more time."
 origin_tooltip_ceaseless_gaze: "Start with a §YRelic World§! as your homeworld. \nA §SSurveyor Probe§! is guaranteed to spawn somewhere in the galaxy. Although it does not recognize you as its masters, you will have contact with it."
 START_SCREEN_CEASELESS_GAZE: "Our ancestors, although spacefaring, neglected to expand across the galaxy. Instead, they built a series of sophisticated probes capable of spotting and neutralizing any alien threat. In their belief that adequate galactic surveillance would keep them safe, they have become complacent - and when a disaster devastated our homeworld, they were not prepared. \n\nIn the centuries it took us to rebuild, "Ceaseless Gaze"-class probes travelled far across the galaxy before returning to [Capital_Scope.GetName], filing reports that none could decipher and requesting new orders from their dead creators. Although we tried to contact them many times, they did not recognize us as legitimate successors to the Alkree Imperium that built them. \n\nOver time, the probes either broke down or were destroyed. Today, nearly all of them have ceased operations... except for one. Now we are once again ready to leave the confines of our ancestral home. We will not make the same mistakes of the Imperium of old, but CG-7442 is still out there and represents an unknown quantity."

 surveyor.100.origin.1: "You look familiar. Have we met before?"
 surveyor.100.origin.2: "If my calculations are correct, there's an 85% chance the [Root.GetName] might be a legitimate successor state to the §SAlkree Imperium§!. I estimate a margin of error within 122%. \n\nWhich means there's a 37% chance you are actually the anti-successor to the Alkree Imperium. Or perhaps successor to the Anti-Alkree Imperium. Quite a frightening implication."
 surveyor.100.d: "Our ancestors built you. Don't you realize it?"
 surveyor.100.d.answer: "You are making quite a bold claim... But it's also unsubstantiated, and unsubstantiated implications are bad. \n\nThey are, indeed no better than lies. And lies are bad. Lies are so bad, they should be illegal, and might well be depending on the jurisdiction you are in (or unsubstantiatedly claim to be in). Please do not make unsubstantiated claims."

 surveyor_fc_2: "We found a way to communicate with the probe."
 surveyor.602.name: "Contacting the Probe"
 surveyor.602.desc: "We managed to partially crack the code for the probe's signals and send in a request for communications. After a few attempts, we are finally getting a response."

Just get off this very important, very very private channel. \n\nI am a surveyor probe designed and employed by the §YAlkree Imperium§! to explore the galaxy and assess the situation for my creators.

In anticipation of impact, Zomarr authorities distributed a sample of a new type of nanomachines for citizens to inject themselves with. While a few refused, most had their brains scanned and bodies disassembled into nanite swarms, each capable of maintaining a Zomarr mind it consumed. This way they survived the devastation of their world. \n\nEver since we stepped on the planet, they have been trying to communicate, although due to power requirements, most remain dormant and only a few are active at any given time.

 # Ground Team
under_blanket.3.name: "Ground Team"
 under_blanket.3.desc: "Our expedition has passed the first layers of sedimentary rock and is reporting back. Multiple signs of artificial erosion around the walls indicates the presence of lifeforms. An estimation approximates that thousands of this species' individuals are nearby or have passed through this very location. The team's proximity sensors warn the team of approaching heat signatures. Forced to stop, they heard rustlings in the rock approaching ever nearer to them. Should these aliens be aggressive, our small expedition could potentially be overrun within moments.\n\nContact is imminent."
 under_blanket.3.retreat.xenomilit: "To all units, retreat immediately."
 under_blanket.3.retreat.others: "It's too dangerous to proceed. Retreat."
 under_blanket.3.contact.materialist: "What are their intentions? Did we disturb them?"
 under_blanket.3.contact.xenomilit: "Get the soldiers ready. Protect the scientists."
 under_blanket.3.contact.others: "Exercise caution but proceed with the investigation."
 
 # Retreat - First Outcome
 under_blanket.10.name: "Retreat"
 under_blanket.10.desc: "After receiving the order, the squad quickly tried to escape. Loud, guttural groans of the unknown xeno vibrated around the cave's walls. Out of the shadows, dozens of beasts charged our team, and three of our soldiers were instantly ripped to shreds. Striking from gaps in the walls, multiple large claws violently eviscerated six other members. Only [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] and one soldier managed to make it to the exit. Feeling that it was his sense of duty to protect [Root.GetName], the remaining soldier sacrificed himself with an emergency nuclear warhead, allowing [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] to escape and leave the horror behind."
 under_blanket.10.xenomilit: "Damn abominations!"
 under_blanket.10.others: "We will remember them."

 # Retreat - Second Outcome
 under_blanket.11.name: "Retreat"
 under_blanket.11.desc: "While exiting, the group barely realized that an almost undetectable moving form was following in the shadows. Our soldiers shot the invisible form with powerful energy emitter bolts, incapacitating the unknown menace. After taking the xeno to a shielded cell on the ship, the most capable scientists concluded that the specimen was a juvenile with multiple DNA mutations.\n\nThe exit to the tunnels has since been sealed."
 under_blanket.11.xenomilit: "The dissection of this xeno will educate us."
 under_blanket.11.others: "Observation of this xeno will reveal its species' secrets."

 # Retreat - Third Outcome
 under_blanket.12.name: "Retreat"
 under_blanket.12.desc: "Exercising caution, the expedition crew moved their way towards the exit of the tunnel.\nThe monitors were eerily silent. The team managed to secure the cave's entrance, leaving the alien life form a mystery. Our scientists had time to launch an orb scan, giving us precious architectural information.\n\n[under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] plans to keep monitoring the situation remotely."
 under_blanket.12.xenomilit: "Bomb the site."
 under_blanket.12.others: "This new species hasn't revealed all its secrets yet."
 
 # First Contact - First Outcome
 under_blanket.20.name: "First Contact"
 under_blanket.20.desc: "[under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] orders the escort to hold back. With hesitation, a small unknown figure approaches our group. The scientist extends his hand to initiate friendly contact. The creature carefully smells the hand before rubbing its head into it. After a brief moment, a guttural moaning noise comes out of the creature. Suddenly, [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] gets rapidly swarmed by hundreds of these small furry specimens. These strange, innocent animals seem to enjoy cuddling a lot."
 under_blanket.20.xenomilit: "They can be used as slave labour."
 under_blanket.20.others: "Our people will likely adopt them."

 # First Contact - Second Outcome
 under_blanket.21.name: "First Contact"
 under_blanket.21.desc: "The scientific mission pursues its investigations into a large chamber. Our temperature and humidity measuring instruments reveal a tropical ecosystem containing vegetation and water, perfectly designed for wildlife. Tens of thousands of small organic creatures seem to peacefully live here. Early observations suggest that the awake creatures are watchmen guarding the hibernating ones.\n\n[under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] and the scientific consortium will continue the research remotely to prevent any contamination and avoid disturbing the creatures."
 under_blanket.21.xenophobe: "Bomb the site, we can't take risks."
 under_blanket.21.others: "A fascinating self-sufficient species."
 
 # First Contact - Third Outcome
 under_blanket.22.name: "First Contact"
 under_blanket.22.desc: "The wildlife we have discovered is far more violent and dangerous than we first expected. While trying to communicate that we came in peace, [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] was lacerated by the claws of the beasts. We had to abort the mission and secure the zone. Thanks to our heavy autocannon sentries armed with nuclear-grade ammunition, we easily contained the rush of beasts. While the backup team secured the exit, thousands of bullets and growls could be heard behind the reinforcements that were urgently being deployed."
 under_blanket.22.xenomilit: "Damn abominations!"
 under_blanket.22.others: "A regrettable loss."

 # First Contact - Fourth Outcome
 under_blanket.23.name: "First Contact"
 under_blanket.23.desc: "Even after taking precautions when approaching the wildlife, [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] still ended up surrounded. The alpha creature gave a single brutal guttural groan as it shredded the scientist into tatters. The escort rapidly fired back but were trampled by thousands of the creatures. The last communications from the backup team reported a big earthquake before the signal suddenly went dead. We have been overrun by this dangerous wildlife.\n\nWe must abandon the mission and secure the region immediately."
 under_blanket.23.desc.delayed: "What was seen by automatic systems as regular earthquakes in an area of [Root.GetName] has alerted military radars.\n\nMultiple unknown signatures converged in an area where we had established several large cities. Shortly after a couple of cycles of invasions by these unknown signatures, we lost contact with the region. A third of the area was reportedly destroyed and completely overrun with no survivors. Critical orbital strikes were ordered to contain the propagation.\n\nAnalysis of raw data shows that the invasion originated from an unexplored and unsecured underground cavity. The scientific community has strongly criticised our failure to study while we had the chance."
 under_blanket.23.desc.captured: "The captured adolescent creature has started to reveal its secrets. As innocent as it looks for its size, about half the size of a [root.owner.GetName], its three large, sharp claws fixed on its neck shouldn't be ignored. Composed of eight support members, the alien was capable of moving all around its cell with remarkable agility. The bulky chest hides twelve small hearts, protected by a body armour shaped of harder rotten flesh that showed great resistance. Dietarily, it has an exclusive preference for living things, especially their brains. Specialists can't uncover any kindness or intelligence, it seems many driven by its survival instincts.\n\nHowever, the mutant keeps sending undetectable low frequency signals to the cave.\n\nToday, alarming seismic data all around [Root.GetName] is being reported. The dangerousness of the early signals has triggered a planetary security protocol, with military forces deployed to all regions. Swarms a fourth the size of the alien previously studied rushed us from the ground. Well prepared and entrenched, most of the assault is contained thanks to our knowledge of their weak points and the courage of our forces. Unfortunately, with the fighting hardest at the area around the cave, many lives were lost in this region."
 under_blanket.23.tooltip: "A pop is killed and §RDangerous Wildlife§! now roams over [Root.GetName]."
 under_blanket.23.xenomilit: "Damn abominations!"
 under_blanket.23.others: "This is a tragedy."
 
 # Under the Blanket - Follow up to Retreat #3
 under_blanket.120.name: "Under the Blanket"
 under_blanket.120.desc: "Our probe finished its route in the underground gallery before being destroyed by the inhabitants. Further analysis of the collected data gives more awareness about the unknown organism. Signatures show it tends to continue to expand and growth, which can be seen as dangerous even if it doesn't cause any destabilisation or harm on [Root.GetName].\n\nThe science department, headed by [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName], concludes that the organic species seems to feed by swallowing crystallites that provide life nutrients and give off gases. Our leadership on [Root.GetName] urges the importance of mining these strategic crystals and decimating the uncontrollable menace." 
 under_blanket.120.noxenophile: "Strategic resources should be prioritised."
 under_blanket.120.all: "Do not harm them. Send an escort."
 
 # Genocide
 under_blanket.121.name: "Genocide"
 under_blanket.121.desc: "We were capable of determining that the gas produced by the organism is highly combustible. The military decided to torch the entire gallery - the crystals being immune, there would be no consequences. From a fortified position around the entrance, the launch sequence of the missile was initiated. An eerie silence made the outpost nervous. As thunderous bursts deep in the cave were heard, a massive fireball engulfed the entrance, the ground crackling under the heat.\n\nIn no time, the sterilizing team made a move inside, equipped with fireproof suits and heavy equipment. The tunnels were sketched by freshly claws marks. They arrived in the biggest chamber, the last known location of the probe - the nest. Suffocation and squeaks of agony surrounded the place. Thousands of creatures cowered in suffering, and the squad quickly realized that the floor was a veil of thousand calcined carcasses. At the edge of the cavity, a horrifically burned creature struggled, trying to reach a shelter before slipping away. Here is the end of a whole life form. Haunted shrieks can still be perceived.n\n\The crystallites remain intact." 
 under_blanket.121.a: "Clean the chamber and start excavation."
 under_blanket.121.b: "At what cost."
 
 # Heritage - First Outcome
 under_blanket.122.name: "Heritage"
 under_blanket.122.desc: "Determined to make contact with the life form, the team carefully rendezvous to the last localization of our orb scanner. As attested beforehand, gas is detected. It is unexpectedly pungent. Thundery deep bursts start to become audible as the escort makes its way closer. The beasts are now visually identified, but they don't look disgruntled by our presence. Hulking with a rock armor and chunky, their gluttonous behavior shows a geophagia diet. As we observe them, our scientists discover that the creatures stop eating the crystals at regular intervals and stand still before kneeling. From a different angle, a large dilatation of the skin is perceptible on the lower body, followed by gas. Something dense came out. [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] is sure of it: They produce enriched minerals."
 under_blanket.122.a: "Fascinating."

 # Heritage - Second Outcome
 under_blanket.123.name: "Heritage"
 under_blanket.123.desc: "[under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] is reported missing. After investigation, a secret stash of casebooks and a custom-built analysis machine are exposed in [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetHisHer] laboratory. Spectrograph sketches, multiple erasures and various annotations all over the pages acknowledge an incredible find by the inexperienced scientist: The gas seems to communicate. Highly volatile and mutagenic, the fume form was able to shape itself into different chemical signatures.\n\nH-I, Co-N-V-Er-Ge, U-S, He-Re, F-O-U-Nd, La-W-S, As, O-Ne.\n\nFollowing a sequence revealing a coordinate based on atomic weight values, a rescue team is on its way.n\n[under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] is found unconscious, levitating naked and holding a spherical obsidian stone on [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetName] chest in the middle of a large crystallite chamber. As the group approach closer, a dense multicolor veil of vapor emerges from [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetHisHer] body, suddenly waking [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetHimHer]. In shock, he proclaims as [under_blanket_selected_leader.GetSheHe] fall[under_blanket_selected_leader.GetSXX]  to the ground: "I know everything, laws converge as one. ""
 under_blanket.123.a: "Fascinating."

There is no genetic variation between individual specimens of each of the two classifications, implying either asexual reproduction or cloning.\n\nThe organisms themselves appear to be the product of genetic engineering, as natural evolution to their current state is highly unlikely. Both X1 and X2 feature exceptionally hardened carapaces similar in durability to military grade armor plates, as well as organs which seemingly acted as mass drivers for organic projectiles, of which our exploration team has found a multitude still buried inside of various wrecks. Judging by the debris fields, they must have been formidable combatants."

 vazuran_systems.102.desc:0 "After spending multiple weeks exploring various wrecks within the vast debris field spanning the [root.solar_system.GetName] system, our exploration team made a major breakthrough. When investigating one of the wrecks, it became clear that they had identified the former fleet's flagship. Furthermore, the ship was found to house a still intact data storage, from which our [root.owner.GetScientistResearchSubroutinePlural] were able to reconstruct the events that took place here roughly four thousand years ago.\n\nTheir empire fought a desperate war against an extragalactic invading force of voidborn lifeforms which consumed all biomass in their way, growing ever stronger the more they consumed.\n\nWith the swarm closing in on this once thriving population center of multiple settled worlds, and only a token force in range to meet the attackers in time, the admiral had to make a hard decision. Knowing he could neither save his people nor defeat his foes, he decided to instead destroy every colonized world in the system in an effort to deny the enemy the biomass they were coming for, before engaging them in battle to give the rest of his people's fleet as much time as possible to close in on the threat.\n\nThe last entry of the admiral's log reads: §SSome may question my right to destroy planets with tens of billions of souls, but those who understand will realize that I had no right to let them live. No sacrifice can be too great when our entire galaxy is at stake. They did their duty and so shall we...§!\n\nOur mere existence seems to prove that his sacrifice was not in vain."

These events must have taken place many thousands of years ago, and remnants on the surface are too decayed and eroded to draw any further conclusions.\n\nJust as [root.Leader.GetName] was about to wrap up [root.Leader.GetHisHer] investigations, the [root.GetName]'s scanners picked up a set of tiny, suspiciously identical objects orbiting [From.GetName]'s moon. These turned out to be artificial satellites containing data cores.

We thought we could stop the 'Destroyers'. We were not a young race like the others they have brought down - we have travelled the galaxy for a millennium. But they have bested us.

Though the application of this technology to our own fleet might seem tempting at first, our experiments demonstrated problematic side-effects caused by this protective device. The suppression of energy transmission is not limited on energy coming from outside its zone of effect but affects internal ship systems as well. So far, no way of shielding them from the damper field's effects has been found.\n\nOur [root.GetScientistResearchSubroutinePlural] have only managed to gain a rudimentary understanding of the technology's underlying scientific principles.

 voggo_dig_site_desc: "A large station is hovering in the upper atmosphere of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. \n\nIts exterior, though weathered heavily from the passage of time and powerful winds, is unusually luxurious. The station itself seems to have been abandoned long ago."

 voggo.1.name: "The Antechamber"
 voggo.1.desc: "Mapping out and cataloguing the luxurious interiors of the station on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! took significant effort. The damage sustained has turned the twisting passages into hazardous and the air inside has become dangerously volatile from malfunctioning life-support systems. \n\nThe strangest thing about all this seems to be the decorations. Every room contains at least one statue or portrait of the same individual striking some kind of magnificent pose."
 voggo.2.name: "Send in the Clones"
 voggo.2.desc: "As archaeologists on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! pushed into the depths of the station's interiors, they started encountering dead bodies. Some of them were killed by gunfire, blades and blunt implements, but others seem to have perished from life support failure. \n\nAll of the bodies appear to be genetically identical, bearing strong resemblance to the portraits aboard. However, different bodies show different levels of development and health - some were significantly disfigured compared to the others or show shrunken cranial areas. \n\n[Leader.GetName] believes that all of them are clones of the same individual replicated with different degrees of success. The most degenerated ones were probably the result of multiple generations of cloning."
 voggo.3.name: "Cloning Laboratory"
 voggo.3.desc: "Closer to the core of the station, [Leader.GetName] has found several rooms seemingly dedicated to cloning. It seems to have been the site of a major battle, as most of the equipment is smashed or shot to pieces. Cloning vats still contain half-formed bodies, and sampling machines are badly damaged, as if someone kept smashing them to reach whoever was inside."
 voggo.4.name: "The Inner Sanctum"
 voggo.4.desc: "Until now, we believed the station was abandoned. We were mistaken. \n\nIn the innermost part of the station, [Leader.GetName] discovered a sealed off section shielded from the outside. \n\nInside, [Leader.GetSheHe] has discovered a living alien that also shares its appearance with the portraits in the station. Judging by the lack of disfiguring genetic defects, he is likely the original template for the clones whose corpses litter that station. He wishes to speak to us."

I was once the ruler of the great and bountiful §YVorkun Nation§!, do you recognize the name?\n\nNo? Thought so... Serves them right.\n\nNow that I am finally free, please allow me to offer you my services. I am the most capable administrator you'll ever come to know."

 voggo.5.b: "We'd rather not employ you."
 voggo.5.c: "What's your story?"
 voggo.5.c.responce: "Oh, this is a thrilling tale, full of intrigue, treachery and betrayal. I wrote a book about it a few decades ago, but I think I accidentally processed it through one of the food machines. Don't worry, I'll write another one. For now, I'll give you an abridged version.S\n\nThe §YVorkun Nation§! I hail from was once a powerful empire on the galactic stage and I was its leader. I wasn't the only one, but I was gifted with talents others were not. I could see things hidden from most. People would look up to me and always consulted me on important matters, recognizing my endless wisdom. Times were good, for a while. \n\nBut being blessed with foresight and power can be a terrible curse. While the other Vorkuns lived their lives in happy ignorance, I anticipated a terrible calamity. I saw the writing on the wall, and it was mostly obscene doodles. \n\nI came before the Great Senate, saying that they had a choice - give me absolute power or perish. They said that I have a choice - exile or death. They made their choice and I made mine. From the looks of it, I was right, and they were wrong."
 voggo.5.d: "What happened on this station?"
 voggo.5.d.responce: "This was my private station, my safe haven. After arriving in my exile, I was fresh out of friends, allies and companions, and I had no choice but to make my own. Who else would qualify for the position if not someone who'd share my boundless intelligence? So I procured a few cloning machines and started the work. \n\nThe process was more flawed than I anticipated however, as my clones were not blessed with the same level of patience and compassion as I. Many turned against me. As I sought refuge in my innermost sanctum, they turned on one another, and each tried to clone themselves into an army. Soon the first generation of clones was dead, but each left behind their own clones. Generation after generation, they grew more numerous and less sane, until life support could no longer put up with them. I was protected by my own personal equipment while they suffocated. \n\nIt was fun, for a while. But I'm glad they all died."

 wargames_station_site_desc: "Tucked away on the outskirts of the system, hidden by the atmosphere of a gas giant, this abandoned station definitely warrants a study."

 wargame.3.name: "The Hangar"
 wargame.3.desc: "It wasn't that hard to find an entry point to the station. A shuttle hangar is left wide open, and the air has been vented, leaving no atmosphere in this section of the station. \n\nScorch marks from energy weapons are seen on some of the walls, along with, surprisingly enough, impacts from chemically propelled ballistic weaponry. The reason for the air venting remains unclear for now - but it was definitely not due to fighting."
 wargame.4.name: "The Viewing Hall"
 wargame.4.desc: "Archaeologists are making progress inside the station orbiting [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nTheir most recent discovery is a large room, with walls covered with large screens and filled with amenities for large numbers of viewers. A bar, tables and seating are identifiable. Minor signs of fighting, such as shattered glasses and broken screens, can also be seen."

 wargame.5.desc: "[Leader.GetName] reports the successful investigation of a strange station orbiting [From.Planet.GetName]. \n\nJudging by surviving data cores, the system was set up as a massive experiment, or possibly a form of entertainment. \n\nFour species were uplifted by an unknown party, provided with FTL-incapable warships and set to fight each other, while their benefactors could watch from a safely hidden location on the system's outskirts. \n\nThe experiment came to abrupt end when a group of conspirators from all four species infiltrated the station and massacred everyone on board.

 we_are_gods.2.desc:0 "It seems the natives of this planet have come to believe we are... gods. This left us in a very awkward spot when one of our research teams were discovered and the natives fell on their knees instead of attacking them. Religions based on the worship of us are on a steady rise throughout their society, including some that refer to us as those that will "ascend them to a higher plane of existence". It does make it easier to abduct natives for further study though, given that they basically offer themselves."

 wpdr.4.desc: "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports successfully boarding and studying the interior of §SIndomitable Valor§! - a massive battleship found in [capital_ship.Solar_System.GetName]. \n\nThe ship was built and operated by the §SUniversal Transport Alliance§!, an organization formed in the aftermath of some kind of galactic political crisis several thousands of years ago. Many powers present at the time have collapsed, leaving trade routes unprotected and vulnerable to rising piracy, until the non-government organization had to step in. The Alliance operated a number of massive capital ships such as the Indomitable Valor, known as §YMobile Weapon Deployment Rigs§!, which manufactured small ships capable of effectively pursuing pirate ships and engage them with long-range weapons. \n\nFor a while, the Alliance was generously financed by governmental and private benefactors and was able to not only push back against piracy, but also invest heavily in their own infrastructure. However, as the pirate threat diminished and the Alliance's power grew, various forces became dissatisfied with UTA's dominance and demanded its dissolution. Most of the officers eventually defected to their native empires, and those who didn't were hunted down. The Indomitable Valor was the last surviving Rig that defended Alliance's headquarters. It seems that its enemies opted to not pursue the lone ship and over time the crew abandoned it or died, leaving it in automatic defense mode. \n\nNow, the ship is damaged beyond repair. We were, however, able to extract the Manufacturing Matrix responsible for creating new platforms."
