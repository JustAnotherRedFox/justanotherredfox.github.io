# Chronical Decease 
## Insomnia
* Pronounced mental or physical unrest causes insomnia, insomnia means one can often feel sluggish or exhausted and find themselves hardly ever capable of sleep.

## hyper-coagulation
* Higher red blood-cell count means hyper-coagulation occurs, causing wounds to bleed much less profusely

## hemophilia
* Hemophilia is the inability for blood to clot properly, causing wounds to bleed much more profusely.

# Deceases
## Minor Hemophilia
* Effect: Bad coagulation, bleading delay to stop, any cut can be lethal
* requirements:
    * vitamin: K = lower than 5%
    
# Electric Shock
* Received Amperage
    * 1mA:
        * tingling sensation 
        * may be enough to drop tools in hand

    * 5mA:
        * subtle shock, 
        * subject will let go objects in hand, 
        * intense involuntary spasms
        
    * 6 ~ 16mA:
        * painful shock, 
        * loss of muscular control, 
        * individual cannot separate from electrical source

    * 17 ~ 99mA:
        * Extreme pain, 
        * lung failure, 
        * strong muscular contractions, 
        * individual cannot separate from electrical source, 
        * possibly fatal

    * 100 ~ 2000mA:
        * Unbearable pain
        * Severely abnormal heartbeat, 
        * extreme muscular contractions, 
        * nerve damage may occur, 
        * likely resulting in death

    * > 2000mA:
        * heart stop beating, 
        * severe damage and burns on internal organs, 
        * probable death
