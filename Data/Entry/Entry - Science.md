### Seruns
#### Seruns Tiers 
* Description:
    > Used to rise the limit of the human body in an especific department 
* Starting form C++ Rank to humans gets further they have to inject themselves with a expansive serum for each minor realm(-, +, ++) for each attribute 
(strength,
agility,
control(hand and feet dex.),
efficiency (organs)
mind)
* Radiation level increase for each realm for human and animals
* the heigher the tier of the serum, more satureted and fluorescent it's get. Ex.: the tier 5 Greater Strength serun(EX++ to Z-) has a bright green color
* The radioactive atmosphere make all creatures have a certain level of radiation
